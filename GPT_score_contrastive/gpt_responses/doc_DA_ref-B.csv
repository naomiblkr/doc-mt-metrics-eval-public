The machine translation accurately conveys the main points of the sentence and maintains the overall meaning and tone of the original text. However, there are some minor errors in grammar and word choice that could be improved upon. For example, ""schien"" (seemed) is not the best choice of verb to use in this context, and ""sichtbar blieben"" (remained visible) could be more accurately translated as ""online blieben"" (remained online). Additionally, the use of ""schreienden"" (blatant) instead of ""unverhohlenen"" (unconcealed) is not entirely accurate. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality but could benefit from some minor improvements."
