The machine translation is very good and captures the meaning of the original sentence accurately. However, there are a few minor errors in grammar and word choice that could be improved upon. For example, ""Vernehmungsbefehl"" should be translated as ""questioning warrant"" instead of ""interrogation warrant"". Additionally, the use of ""feststellte"" instead of ""betonte"" in the second sentence changes the tone slightly and could be seen as less forceful. Overall, the translation is very close to the human reference and conveys the same message effectively."
