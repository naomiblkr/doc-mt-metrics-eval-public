(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while thanking the President of the Commission and Mr Tajani for their efforts, we of Lega Nord must say that we are completely and utterly dissatisfied.
This debate seems surreal to me.
It is a con, a downright con.
Some excited left-wing Members are suggesting that we agree on uniform sizing, while we do not know the origin of the goods worn by consumers.
So much for free market!
I would like the surreal debate of this Tuesday evening - which was held in a half-empty Parliament - to be heard by a few thousand of the manufacturers that survived the crisis in the sector.
I understand the logic of compromise, but the current text destroys the one which resulted from the first reading and was voted for by an overwhelming majority.
It was a balanced text that took account of the needs of both producers and consumers.
Since then it has been a complete fiasco: if I am not mistaken only two out of the 27 Member States have asked that the consumer be informed of the composition of garments, and the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has ignored this fact.
Is this not yet another demonstration that Europe is light years away from the interests of citizens, be they producers or consumers?

. It is only natural that environmental issues, and climate change in particular, should be uppermost among our concerns.
I support many of the guidelines on environmental policy that Europe has been pursuing, reflected in both the report and the Commission communication.
I believe, however, that there are two points that we must bear in mind. Firstly, environmental issues are obviously not at the forefront of the concerns of developing countries, and indeed they are not alone in that respect.
Secondly, developed societies are not prepared to accept a lower standard of living, and nor should this be our policy or our blueprint.
This is precisely why research and development needs to be our major priority, given that the aim should be to manage resources, thereby ensuring a better and more sustainable quality of life.

Commission fines ADM, Ajinomoto, others in lysine cartel
The decision highlights the Commission's determination to fight cartels, the most damaging of all anti-competitive practices.
Lysine is the most important amino acid used in animal foodstuffs for nutritional purposes.
Amino acids are building blocks of protein.
They can also be manufactured.
The availability of synthetic amino acids enables nutritionists to compose protein diets that better meet the animal's feed requirements.
The Commission's extensive investigation found that Archer Daniels Midland Co (USA), Ajinomoto Co (Japan), Cheil (Korea), Kyowa Hakko (Japan) and Sewon (Korea) fixed lysine prices worldwide, including in the European Economic Area.
They have also fixed sales quota for that market and operated an information exchange in order to underpin these quotas from at least July 1990 to June 1995.
The Commission considers that the cartel represents a very serious infringement of the EC competition rules and justifies heavy fines.
Three other cartel participants started to cooperate with the Commission at a later stage.
The Notice provides for a maximum reduction in the fine of 50% in such a case.
The Commission takes the view that it can grant this maximum reduction to Ajinomoto.
The Commission also grants a 50% reduction to Sewon.
Cheil and Kyowa also provided the Commission with evidence confirming the existence of the infringements.
They receive smaller reductions of 30 % each.
Archer Daniels Midland did not co-operate with the Commission during the investigation.
However, it did not contest the facts set out in the Commission's Statement of Objections.
For this, the company receives a 10 % reduction in the fine.
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said:
"This decision is rigorous and balanced.
On the one hand, the Commission needs to be tough on these sort of hardcore cartels.
They must have a deterrent effect.
On the other hand, we do take the Leniency Notice at heart.
This is borne out by the significant reductions in the fines for Ajinomoto and Sewon, the two companies who co-operated most with my services".
(PL) Mr President, in spite of the grand declarations that the Lisbon Treaty would improve the function of the European Union, it turns out that it has opened a Pandora's box.
Its provisions are not precise, and not only are they causing controversy, but they are already causing a division among the EU's leaders.
The treaty does not specify the prerogatives of the future President of the European Council, nor does it specify a democratic procedure for election to this position, and the President's real standing will be dependent on strength of personality and previously held function.
It is also difficult to see whether the classic model of national presidencies, which set the tone of EU policy, will be retained.
Things look similar with regard to the European Union Minister for foreign affairs.
The majority of Europe's citizens are waiting for an answer to the question as to whether we are moving towards the establishment of a strong European federal state at the cost of the sovereignty of nations and if, in the future, a strong Council President will not want to revert to the antidemocratic traditions of 20th century Europe.
Germany’s Four Neins
BERLIN – Germany’s stance toward Europe has become one of rejection and disengagement.
Its policymakers deny the eurozone’s crisis-ridden countries a more active fiscal policy; refuse to support a European investment agenda to generate demand and growth; have declared a fiscal surplus, rather than faster potential growth, as their primary domestic goal; and have begun turning against the European Central Bank (ECB) in the struggle against deflation and a credit crunch.
On all four counts, Germany is wrong.
To be sure, Germany is justified in rejecting narrow-minded calls by France and Italy for unconditional fiscal expansion.
After all, fiscal stimulus can work only if it supports private investment and is accompanied by much more ambitious structural reforms – the kind of reforms that France and Italy are currently resisting.
But Germany has all of the leverage it needs to implement the stability-oriented reforms that it wants for Europe.
For starters, Germany, together with the European Commission, can compel France to pursue deeper reforms in exchange for more time to consolidate its deficit.
Germany cannot, however, indulge its obsession with supply-side reforms without also pursuing growth-enhancing policies.
As Germany knows from its own experience in the early 2000s, the benefits of supply-side reforms – namely, improved competitiveness and higher long-term growth rates – take a long time to emerge.
Time is a luxury that Europe does not have.
With every month that the economy loses productive capacity, the likelihood of stagnation and deflation rises.
The key to ending the European crisis is a stimulus plan that addresses deficiencies on both the supply and demand sides.
That is why Germany’s refusal to help find a way to finance the proposed European investment agenda – which, for a limited time, would fund productive private investment – is a mistake.
Equally problematic is Germany’s focus on maintaining a fiscal surplus.
With projections for German GDP growth this year and next revised downward by more than 0.6 percentage points in the last few months, the government could be forced to initiate a pro-cyclical fiscal policy to achieve its goal, inducing even lower growth at home and throughout the eurozone.
Given that the German economy’s output gap remains negative, the government should be implementing expansionary fiscal policy that targets the country’s infrastructure weaknesses.
In this sense, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s plan to spend an additional €10 billion ($12.5 billion) on public investment in 2016-2018 is a step in the right direction.
But, at just 0.1% of Germany’s annual GDP, Schäuble’s scheme looks more like an attempt to quiet criticism from the rest of Europe than a genuine policy shift.
Germany’s fourth policy mistake is its apparent withdrawal of support for the ECB.
Over the last seven years, the ECB’s actions have helped Germany’s economy and taxpayers as much as those of its neighbors.
Moreover, the claim that the ECB’s purchases of asset-backed securities amount to “toxic loans” that transfer risk to German taxpayers is unfounded; after all, there have been almost no defaults since 2008.
Germany’s leaders need to recognize this – and to defend the ECB publicly from baseless fear mongering.
Failure to do so may reflect an effort to forestall the rise of the far-right anti-European political forces, particularly the Alternative for Germany.
But this strategy merely plays into the party’s hands.
If Germany refuses to take a more reasoned approach, it risks undermining the ECB’s credibility, thereby reducing the effectiveness of its measures.
If that happens, the ECB may well be compelled to initiate large-scale purchases of eurozone government bonds through its so-called “outright monetary transactions” scheme – a plan that many German policymakers and economists staunchly oppose.
The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need, while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone.
And it has the authority to bolster the ECB’s credibility and thus its efforts to ensure future price stability and prevent financial contagion.
Europe needs a grand bargain, involving close coordination on structural reforms and fiscal and monetary policy.
Germany’s relative economic and political stability, far from enabling it to disengage from such efforts, makes it among the most important protagonists in their development and implementation.
The question is whether Germany’s leaders will recognize this before Europe’s economy falls into an even deeper slump.
Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes
(NL) Mr President, Mr Prodi, you more than anyone are familiar with how the European institutions work.
As a former President of the Commission, you are therefore well placed to fathom why the European citizens are increasingly turning their backs on present-day Europe.
Bureaucracy, overregulation, no ounce of respect for the principle of subsidiarity, political correctness, no respect for Europe's Christian heritage, and the obsessive desire to admit Islamic Turkey to the EU have meant that these days, most Europeans equate the European ideal of the founding fathers with an intrusive super state that no longer listens to what the people want.
In recent years, we have seen some striking examples of the deliberate deafness of official Europe.
In France and the Netherlands, in democratic referendums, the people said 'no' to the European super state.
Despite this, the German Presidency simply carries on down the path already chosen.
For Angela Merkel, and I am afraid for you as a Member of the European Council, the will of the people does not count.
All opinion polls show that whilst the Europeans want to be on friendly terms with the Turks, they do not want a non-European and Islamic country to join our Union.
Again, the pre-determined path is simply followed.
Do not harbour any illusions, though.
This refusal to listen to the needs and complaints of Europeans will backfire at the next opportunity, and official Europe should not come and complain to us if the citizens again vote 'incorrectly' at some stage in the future.
I should like to finish off by saying to Mr Prodi that the government of my country brought itself into disrepute last week by refusing, for commercial reasons, to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Belgium.
Nobody wants to offend China.
It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral.
I therefore hope that, within the European Council, you will speak up to focus on the attitude of your government which, although it likes to wax lyrical about human rights, when the chips are down, lets its own economic interests prevail, and also to denounce Belgium in this matter.
If Europe is serious about defending human rights, it should also have the courage to denounce the hypocrisy of some Member States.
PRESSE 47
Declaration by the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, on behalf of the European Union on Zimbabwe
"The European Union is committed to supporting the peaceful progress and democratic development of the people of Zimbabwe.
It reaffirms its support for the full implementation of the Global Political Agreement (GPA) which allowed the creation of the Government of National Unity.
It also welcomes progress made towards the creation of a conducive environment for the holding of free, fair, peaceful and transparent elections through the development of the Road Map sponsored by SADC.
It pays tribute to the efforts of SADC and the South African Facilitator in accompanying the Zimbabwean Government along that road.
In recognition of these developments and to encourage further progress in the implementation of the GPA, the EU has today decided to remove 51 individuals and 20 entities from the visa ban and the asset freeze list with immediate effect.
112 individuals and 11 entities who are still considered to be involved in or associated with policies and activities that undermine human rights, democracy and the rule of law will remain subject to the measures.
We have also decided to extend the restrictions on development assistance for only six months with a view to begin preparing for enhanced cooperation as and when these measures can be lifted.
Despite the restrictions, since the establishment of the GNU, the EU has provided close to US$ 1 billion in development assistance to address the needs of the Zimbabwean people, including in the provision of health care and education services.
The EU remains the largest contributor of development assistance and stands ready to maintain appropriate levels of funding over the next year.
We look forward to strengthening this trade relationship as the economic environment improves.
The EU reaffirms its desire to engage in a serious political dialogue with Zimbabwe.
To facilitate this process we have also suspended travel restrictions on the two ZANU-PF members of the Zimbabwean Ministerial Re-engagement Team so that the full team can come to Brussels for high-level consultations.
Whilst we note that the overall situation in Zimbabwe has improved, further political reforms in accordance with the commitments in the GPA are necessary for a democratic and peaceful Zimbabwe.
The EU remains ready to reconsider the measures at any time in response to concrete progress in the implementation of the GPA and the preparation of credible and peaceful elections.
The EU will recognise and work with any government formed as the result of such a process."
The Acceding Country Croatia*, the Candidate Countries Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia*, Montenegro*, Iceland + and Serbia, the Countries of the Stabilisation and Association Process and potential candidates Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the EFTA countries Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Armenia and Georgia align themselves with this declaration.

General questions
What is the purpose of this Communication?
The European Commission has presented today detailed new guidance on how it will apply the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to strengthen the link between structural reforms, investment and fiscal responsibility in support of jobs and growth.
The guidance, which the Commission will apply as of now, has three key aims:
Encourage effective implementation of structural reforms;
Promote investment, specifically in the context of the new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) (see press release IP/15/3222 );
Take better account of economic cycle in individual Member States.
Why is the Commission presenting these ideas now?
The Communication follows the commitment made in the Political Guidelines of President Juncker, on the basis of which the European Parliament elected the European Commission: "
I intend to issue concrete guidance on this as part of my ambitious Jobs, Growth and Investment Package."
We respect the Stability and Growth Pact.
All our economies need to continue to pursue structural reforms.
Very clearly, our common strength hinges upon each and every country's success.
That is why the Union needs bold steps to foster growth, increase investments, create more and better jobs and encourage reforms for competitiveness.
This also requires making best use of the flexibility that is built into the existing Stability and Growth Pact rules."
Is the Commission watering down the Stability and Growth Pact and reducing pressure on Member States to bring down their excessive deficits and debt?
No.
Adequate safeguards and conditions are in place to ensure that while the best use is made of the flexibility within the Pact, its credibility and effectiveness in upholding fiscal responsibility are preserved.
This is fundamental for the sustainability of public finances and for financial stability in the EU.
Since the Pact was created in 1997, it has been reformed and complemented, notably in 2005 and in 2011-13.
It is now applied at different points in the year as part of the overall annual cycle of economic policy coordination at EU level, known as the European Semester.
This Communication does not amend any of the provisions of the Pact.
Instead, it is part of the Commission's efforts to further reinforce the effectiveness and understanding of its rules, to give Member States additional predictability in how the Commission will apply the Pact and to ensure their equal treatment, which is at the core of the Pact.
The Communication is also a contribution to develop a more growth-friendly fiscal stance in the euro area.
When will this guidance apply?
The Commission is not proposing any changes to the existing rules.
No legislative steps are needed and the Commission will thus apply this new guidance immediately.
The Commission will enter into a dialogue with Member States and the Council to provide any necessary explanations ahead of forthcoming milestones, notably the presentation of the Stability/Convergence Programmes (Member States' medium-term fiscal plans) and National Reform Programmes expected in spring 2015.
The Commission will also present this Communication to the European Parliament.
2.
Clarifications regarding structural reforms
What flexibility will be available under the “structural reform clause” for countries in the preventive arm of the Pact?
The Communication gives guidance on how structural reforms will be taken into account from now on under the preventive arm of the Pact, (the so-called "structural reform clause").
In line with the rules of the Pact, Member States implementing major structural reforms are allowed to deviate temporarily from their medium-term budget objective (MTO) or the adjustment path towards it.
This allows them to cater for the short-term costs of implementing structural reforms that will have long-term positive budgetary effects, including by raising potential sustainable growth.
From now on, the Commission will take into account the positive fiscal impact of structural reforms under the preventive arm of the Pact, provided that such reforms (i) are major, (ii) have demonstrable long-term positive budgetary effects, including by raising potential sustainable growth, and (iii) are actually implemented.
For reform measures adopted by the government and/or the Parliament to qualify "ex ante", Member States will have to present a dedicated structural reform plan with detailed and verifiable information and a credible timeline.
Provided the above criteria are met, Member States will be granted additional time to reach the MTO, hence allowing temporary deviations from the structural adjustment path towards it, or to temporarily deviate from the MTO for Member States that have reached it.
Moreover, an appropriate safety margin must be continuously preserved so that the deviation does not lead to a breach of the 3% of GDP deficit reference value.
How will this be monitored?
The implementation of the reforms will be monitored closely in the context of the European Semester.
In the specific case of a Member State subject to the Excessive Imbalances Procedure (EIP), the structural reform plans should be set out in the Corrective Action Plan.
The implementation of the reforms will then be monitored through the EIP.
What if countries fail to follow through on their reform commitments?
In case of failure to act, the temporary deviation from the MTO, or from the adjustment path towards it, will no longer be considered as warranted and the Commission may apply the procedure envisaged under the Pact in the case of a significant deviation from the MTO or the path towards it.
What about countries in the corrective arm of the Pact?
The main purpose of the corrective arm is to ensure the prompt correction of excessive deficits.
The relevant rules do not include detailed provisions to take account of structural reforms (or investment) when assessing whether a country has taken effective action in response to the Council's recommendations to correct the excessive deficit.
However, structural reforms are recognised in the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact when deciding different steps in the EDP.
First, when examining whether or not an EDP needs to be opened for a Member State, the Commission carefully analyses all relevant medium-term developments (economic, budgetary and debt).
These "relevant factors" include the implementation of structural reforms.
Second, "relevant factors" are also taken into account when recommending the deadline to correct the excessive deficit.
While the correction of the excessive deficit is expected to take place within a year of its detection, implementing structural reforms is a key factor that is taken into account when setting the deadline to correct the excessive deficit or the length of any extension to that deadline.
As part of this Communication, the Commission indicates that it will also take account of reforms that have not yet been implemented, provided that they have been clearly specified - with a credible timetable for adoption - in a structural reform plan that has to be adopted by the Member State in question. (For Member States with excessive macroeconomic imbalances, the Corrective Action Plan would normally serve this purpose).
In case a Member State fails to implement the agreed reforms, the Commission will consider it an aggravating factor when assessing effective action in response to the EDP recommendation and when setting a deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit.
Lack of effective action will lead to a stepping up of the procedure and the possible suspension of European Structural and Investment Funds.[1] For euro area Member States, this means that the Commission will recommend to the Council the imposition of a fine.
Third, when closing an EDP, the Commission considers, where relevant, the direct cost of pension reforms.
Concretely, an EDP can be closed even if the deficit is over 3% of GDP, provided that the excess is entirely due to the costs of implementing the pension reform and the deficit has been reduced substantially and continuously and has reached a level that comes close to the reference value.
3.
Clarifications regarding investment
Will national contributions to the future European Fund for Strategic Investments count as part of countries’ deficit or debt and will these be taken into account in the application of the Pact?
It confirms that Member States' contributions to the EFSI will not be counted when defining the fiscal adjustment under either the preventive or corrective arm of the Pact, because such contributions can be considered as "one-off measures" that are deducted for the assessment of the fiscal effort in structural terms.
In the case of a 3% deficit reference value is no longer respected, the Commission will not launch an Excessive Deficit Procedure if it is due to the contribution, provided the deviation is small and expected to be temporary.
When assessing respect of the debt reference value, contributions to the EFSI will be considered as a "relevant factor "and this not be taken into account.
In its Investment Plan for Europe, it had already announced that it would take account favourably such contributions under the Pact, and this was echoed by the December 2014 European Council.
What will be the conditions for applying the “investment clause” from now on?
The so-called "investment clause" applies to countries in the preventive arm of the Pact.
The Commission has previously provided guidance on how the Pact can support public investments with positive, direct and verifiable long-term budgetary effects on growth and on the sustainability of public finances.
Today's Communication specifies and formalises this guidance to take better account of country-specific circumstances.
It clarifies that Member States in the preventive arm of the Pact can deviate temporarily from their medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) or adjustment path towards it to accommodate for investment, provided that
(i) their GDP growth is negative or GDP remains well below its potential (with an output gap greater than minus 1.5%);
(ii) the deviation does not lead to a breach of the 3% deficit limit and an appropriate safety margin is preserved;
(iii) investment levels are effectively increased a result.
(iv) Eligible investments are national expenditures on projects co-funded by the EU under the Structural and Cohesion policy (including projects co-funded under the Youth Employment Initiative), Trans-European Networks and the Connecting Europe Facility, and the co-financing of projects also co-financed by the EFSI.
Which countries have benefitted from the investment clause in the past?
Is the Commission introducing a “golden rule”?
No, there is no so-called "golden rule" exempting investment from deficit and debt calculations.
This is not envisaged in the Pact. (The notion of "golden rule" is often discussed, for instance in the academia, but there are various definitions and interpretations).
4.
Clarifications regarding cyclical conditions
How have cyclical conditions been taken into account until now?
The Stability and Growth Pact focuses on improving public finances in structural terms (already ironing out the effects of the economic cycle and/or one-off measures).
For countries in the preventive arm, a medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) is identified, which is updated at least every three years, with the goal of improving their structural budget balance by 0.5% of GDP a year as a benchmark.
This provides an appropriate safety margin against breaching the 3% headline deficit limit, with Member States, particularly those with debts over 60% of GDP, expected to do more when economic times are good and less when they are bad.
What is going to change?
From now on, for Member States in the preventive arm of the Pact, the Commission will use a 'matrix' to set out the appropriate fiscal adjustment and take better account of their cyclical situation.
This means that Member States will be required to make a smaller fiscal effort during difficult economic conditions and a larger fiscal effort during better times (see Annex 1).
The matrix takes into account the direction in which the economy is moving, i.e. whether the economic situation is improving or deteriorating, by distinguishing whether real GDP exceeds or falls short of a country-specific potential growth rate.
In normal times, interpreted as an output gap between -1.5% and +1.5%, all EU Member States with a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% would be required to make an effort of 0.5% of GDP, whereas the Member States with debt levels above 60% of GDP would need to make an adjustment greater than 0.5% of GDP.
In bad times, interpreted as an output gap between -3% and -1.5%, the required adjustment would be lower.
All EU Member States with the debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% would be required to ensure a budgetary effort of 0.25% of GDP when their economies grow above the potential.
Is there anything foreseen for countries under the corrective arm?
For countries which are in the corrective arm and thus subject to the Excessive Deficit Procedure, the Commission has developed a new approach to assessing the delivery of the required structural fiscal effort, which the ECOFIN Council endorsed in June.
This helps to disentangle as much as possible those budgetary developments that can be assumed to be under the control of the government from those linked to an unexpected fall in economic activity.
Under which circumstances would the Commission activate the “crisis clause” of a severe economic downturn?
The Pact takes into account unusually negative economic conditions at the EU or euro area level both in the preventive arm and in the corrective arm.
It states that, in cases of a severe economic downturn in the euro area or the EU as a whole, the pace of fiscal consolidation can be adapted for all Member States, if this does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium-term.
The clause has so far never been applied, although it reflects the logic used at the time of the 2008 financial crisis when the adjustment paths were re-designed for several Member States.
If it were to be activated, this would not mean pausing the fiscal adjustment, but rather re-designing the adjustment path on a country-specific basis, both in terms of the adjustment effort and the deadlines to achieve the targets, taking into account the exceptional circumstances of the severe economic downturn in the euro area or the Union as a whole.
The Commission considers that these provisions should be used as necessary, but only in exceptional circumstances.

Mergers: Commission approves proposed acquisition of Activision by Vivendi
The European Commission has cleared under the EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of Activision Inc., a US publisher of game software, by Vivendi S.A. of France.
The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or any substantial part of it.
Further information relating to this case will be available at:
http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/mergers/cases/index/m100.html#m_5008
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the day will indeed come when we have to separate the good from the evil, but I think that, today, it is more urgent that we make our demands, which are: an immediate truce, with an end to rockets being launched into Israel and to Israeli operations in Gaza; the delivery of humanitarian aid; a lasting ceasefire, with an end to trafficking in weapons and munitions, with effective surveillance of the border between Egypt and Gaza, with the withdrawal of Israeli troops and with the reopening of the crossing points; and, lastly, the lifting of the embargo - and all of this, at the same time.
This will be a highly complex phase, one that will no doubt or most probably require the presence of an international force, and I believe that the Union should prepare itself to take part in this.
I should like to make two additional points.
In order to succeed, the European Union will have to speak and act clearly and not in a disorganised manner.
It is very useful to have good intentions, but it is more important to be effective.
The United States will also have to make a commitment, as will the Arab League and its member countries.
Lastly I would add that, in order to offer a real alternative to the situation in Gaza, Israel will have to significantly improve the situation in the West Bank: 634 checkpoints, the splitting in two of the road network, 8-metre-high walls, as well as the countless acts of humiliation inflicted on the Palestinians, do not offer an appealing enough alternative to the inhabitants of Gaza to make them turn their backs on Hamas.
To conclude, I would say that the day will inevitably come when everyone will have to speak to everyone else.
(Applause)
Brussels, 3 June 2009
A ‘shared commitment for employment’: Commission initiates new strategy to tackle the employment impact of the crisis.
The EU will also frontload funds and co-financing by Member States will not be necessary for 2009-2010.
Together with the European Investment Bank Group and other partners, a new EU loans facility will be set up to provide micro-credits for those who would usually have difficulty accessing the necessary funds to set up a business or micro-enterprise.
The 'EU Shared Commitment for Employment' puts forward key priorities and actions to preserve jobs and help those facing difficulties while paving the way for recovery.
The objective is for all relevant actors, trade unions and employers' organisations, as well as Member States and the EU to work together to deliver on this commitment.
"For example, we are accelerating billions of euros in EU support for retraining under the European Social Fund, which already helps more than 9 million people a year find jobs.
And at national level we want to see 5 million young Europeans have access to apprenticeships.
I call on the European Council to endorse this ambitious plan."
"We have been working closely over recent months with national governments and with workers' and employers' organisations on the best ways to tackle the social impacts of the crisis.
In particular, we need to focus on getting young people into work, and we must not let them miss their entry into the labour market.
The 'Shared Commitment for Employment' is a strong, forward looking and coordinated agenda to fight unemployment, boost job creation and pave the way for a sustainable recovery."
The Commission puts forward three key prio rities: maintaining employment, creating jobs and promoting mobility; upgrading skills and matching labour market needs; and increasing access to employment.
They are also consistent with the EU’s longer term strategies to reform labour markets including the Lisbon Strategy.
There is a particularly strong focus on young people to provide them with the training and work opportunities they need to ensure they don’t miss their entry into the labour market this year because of the crisis.
The Commission proposes a series of actions, including:
For the period 2009-2010, the Commission can reimburse Member States' declared expenditure at a rate of 100%.
A commitment to provide at least 5 million apprenticeships across the EU for young people facing unemployment; and the setting of targets to provide young unemployed with early opportunities for training or work.
Support for schemes – including through the ESF - to maintain viable employment through short-time work and training .
Immediate h elp for the unemployed to avoid the risk of long-term unemployment and the loss of relevant skills, including proposals that an early opportunity for training or work should be provided to each unemployed person: within 1 month for young people under 20 years old, within 2 months for those under 25 years old, and within 3 months for over 25 year olds.
The ESF should support the achievement of these "new start" targets.
Help to get the most disadvantaged back into jobs , for example, through lower non-wage labour costs, recruitment incentives and the promotion of low-skilled job opportunities in household and care services.
A focus on skills upgrading and a better match with labour market needs, with a C ommission sector-by-sector analysis of EU labour market needs today and for the future including green skills.
A practical toolkit to help companies, workers and their representatives better manage and anticipate business restructuring.
A guide for training in small businesses to help SMEs maintain and obtain the skills they need.
The Commission will report on the progress of the EU Shared Commitment and on its implications for the post-2010 Lisbon strategy in time for the 2010 Spring European Council.

Mr President, if one thing has come out of the debate it is that there is concern about effective combating of trafficking in human beings - and, in particular, trafficking in children - amongst a large majority in this House.
That is the greatest use of this measure that we will adopt and I am delighted by the fact that almost all the speakers have touched on this.
I would like to once again thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their collaboration, and that is not idle praise.
It is fair to say that my colleague Mrs Roure played a crucial role in securing the agreement, to which Commissioner Barrot and the French Presidency also contributed a lot.
I particularly wish to thank Commissioner Barrot for the Commission's readiness to give institutional backing to invigorating the fight against trafficking in children, as well as its readiness to collaborate in the three studies which we requested: on the reliability of children's fingerprints, on breeder documents and on false rejection rates, which are some of the concerns that we have in relation to the implementation of these rules.
Finally, Mr President, Mr Brejc raised an issue: he asked if we are able to say that the issuing of passports is secure.
To be completely honest, I have to say that this varies from country to country.
Some countries have more rigorous systems than others, and that is another reason why the study on breeder documents is very important.
I know that Europe has no jurisdiction over this area - the issuing of passports is a national prerogative - and that is why I was very happy when Commissioner Barrot agreed to having the European Commission collaborate in this study on breeder documents.
It makes no sense for us to have passports that are very secure if this security might be sabotaged during the issuing process.
It is a case not of imposing measures on Member States, but of sharing best practices so that we can guarantee that the European passport is a secure reality on our external borders.
Thank you very much to all of you for your collaboration.
. Mr President, the textile industry is a very important economic factor for all of us in Europe and, therefore, internal and external measures must be taken.
We are working on a very comprehensive strategy.
Again, let me just mention a few points because this was a very complex and comprehensive debate.
The Commission has proposed several actions to enhance the competitiveness of the European textile industry in its second communication on the textile industries.
The actions proposed include measures such as strengthening the fight against counterfeiting and piracy; enforcing intellectual property rights; establishing an action plan to address existing trade barriers in third countries; fostering advance technology and textiles and clothing with high added value under the EU's Research and Development Programmes; and ensuring lifelong education and vocational training.
Second, the Commission has established a system for monitoring imports of textiles and clothing products from China.
However, it is too early to draw conclusions on monitoring.
The Textile High Level Group was unable to reach a conclusion in its June 2004 report on the 'Made in the European Union' mark of origin.
The Commission will come back to that and will draw up proposals at a later date.
We will resort to safeguards only as a last resort.
This includes the textiles-specific safeguard clause that was established in China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO.
This is an important and clearly proactive strategy.
Open international trade is also a key factor in the competitiveness of the economy as a whole.
Access to third-country markets allows for the creation of jobs in Europe, which is also a key priority of the Commission.
We are therefore determined to do all it takes to achieve the objective of equal market access so that EU firms in these sectors can exploit their hard-earned know-how and quality.
The Commission will therefore draw up an action plan to address the barriers in third-country markets, and the Doha Development Round will provide the opportunity to carry out a comprehensive review of all the alleged non-tariff barriers.
Finally, I shall say a few more words on China.
Commissioner Mandelson is not here because he is currently visiting China, but I will tell him about today's comprehensive debate and maybe you can go into more detail with him, as the Commissioner responsible for trade, at another time.
I would like to emphasise again that the Commission is monitoring closely China's compliance with the WTO accession commitments, most notably in the framework of the EU-China Textiles Trade Dialogue signed in May of last year by the Trade Commissioner and his Chinese counterpart.
Additionally, in the framework of other dialogues between the Commission and the Chinese authorities, the Commission has requested that the issue of the sustainable development of the textile sector, and in particular the question of corporate social responsibility, be put on the agenda.
The Commission hopes that this will contribute to having the rather strict Chinese labour and environmental laws properly enforced.
We are also conducting a study, which will be finalised shortly, on working and other manufacturing conditions in the textile and clothing sector in China.
In line with the Council's Presidency Conclusions from 2003, the European Union is committed to promoting respect for core labour standards through trade relations with third countries.
The last point I would like to make is about the proposed guidelines on the textile safeguard clause for China.
This is still under preparation.
The Commission wants to examine all sides of the issue thoroughly before taking a final decision.
The Commission is reluctant to do something that would more or less pave the way for the easy introduction of safeguards.
The Commission does not want the guidelines to be a vehicle to facilitate or prompt safeguard action, but one that prevents recourse to safeguards.
The Commission would like these guidelines to introduce transparency in the handling of the requests for safeguards that may be made, but it would also like them to introduce greater predictability in trade, for instance by providing some safe zones, generously established and providing for very large expansion possibilities below which we would not consider safeguard action.
Questions & Answers: EU cooperation on vaccine preventable diseases
What are the benefits of vaccination?
Vaccination is one of the greatest successes of public health.
Before vaccines existed, many children would die young, or become crippled for life.
In Europe, seasonal flu vaccination prevents around 2 million people from getting the flu each year.
Worldwide, vaccination prevents 2.7 million people from contracting measles, 2 million from getting neonatal tetanus, and 1 million from getting pertussis (whooping cough) each year.
Vaccination has also led to the eradication of smallpox, and the near elimination of polio.
Vaccines are a safe and effective way of protecting children and adults from serious illness and complications from vaccine-preventable diseases.
They can prevent a disease from occurring in the first place, saving human suffering, and reducing healthcare costs.
Vaccines protect not only you but others around you, provided that 'herd immunity' is reached.
In the case of measles, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, a 95% coverage rate is required to protect the whole community.
Are vaccines safe?
Yes.
Reports of a link between the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, for example, were based on a now discredited study.
The EU has very strict rules for the market authorisation of vaccines.
On average, it takes 12 to 15 years, including extensive clinical studies, to develop a vaccine.
Once on the market, the European Medicines Agency continues to supervise a vaccine's safety, to detect, prevent and communicate any adverse effects.
Are vaccine-preventable diseases increasing in the EU?
Several EU and neighbouring countries are in the midst of unprecedented outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, due to insufficient vaccination coverage.
Between 2016 and 2017, cases of measles more than tripled in the EU, bringing the total in 2017 to 14,000 cases.
In the past 2 years, over 50 people have died due to measles and 2 from diphtheria.
Seasonal flu vaccination coverage in older age groups has also decreased in the past few years in the majority of EU countries, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that 40,000 people in Europe – many of whom are elderly, die prematurely from complications from seasonal flu every year.
What are the key drivers of falling vaccination coverage?
The first reason is vaccine hesitancy.
Misconceptions about vaccination have shifted the public focus away from the benefits of vaccination, towards distrust in science and fear of possible side effects.
While routine vaccination has led to a sharp reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases, it has also led to the severity of such diseases frequently being underestimated by citizens and healthcare workers alike.
Variation in when vaccines are administered and the number of doses, for example, can cause confusion, and this can result in children not getting all the vaccines they need.
Varying vaccine policies between countries can also lead to the perception that there are differences in opinion on the vaccines themselves.
Other factors that play a role in immunisation gaps include a lack of access to vaccines, vaccine shortages, challenges related to the research and development for new and existing vaccines, including unpredictable demand and insufficient motivation for industry to make the necessary investments in terms of financing and expertise, and constraints linked to public financing.
Why should we step up EU-level cooperation in this area?
Infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and influenza are not confined within national borders.
One EU country's immunisation weakness puts at risk the health and security of citizens across the EU.
Given the cross-border nature of vaccine-preventable communicable diseases, and the common challenges faced by EU countries, there is a clear advantage to strengthening cooperation among all relevant sectors at EU level.
Moreover, Member States themselves have requested intensified EU support, and stressed the need for common EU action and a more coordinated approach.
Why have you chosen a Council Recommendation as the instrument?
Given that the organisation of vaccination programmes is a national competence, the Commission is proposing that Member States agree on a set of joint measures, in the form of a Council Recommendation.
The proposal for a Council Recommendation on vaccine preventable diseases, accompanied by a Commission Communication on the policy rationale of acting together in this area, gives Member States flexibility and takes into account their history, practices and particular cultural challenges.
It is also the best instrument for achieving the desired results.
Who was consulted on the proposal and to what effect?
The Commission consulted stakeholders and citizens, and organised a series of targeted face-to-face meetings with professional healthcare organisations, health NGOs, student organisations and the industry.
The most support was for:
EU and national authorities' support for healthcare professionals in advocating for vaccination and tackling hesitancy;
cientific guidance and information from the EU and its agencies tailored to the specific circumstances of individual EU Member States;
investment in R&D focusing on vaccine safety and effectiveness, with greater transparency and industry involvement.
The online consultation revealed citizens' lack of trust in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines as well as a lack of trust of public authorities and industry.
For instance, 70% of the 8,688 citizens' replies, most of which were from France and submitted to the 12-week consultation within the same 24-hour period, chose ‘no opinion' for all questions and submitted anti-vaccination comments.
These replies suggest that powerful influencers greatly contribute to the current vaccine hesitancy in the EU that the Commission initiative intends to tackle as a key priority.
Timescale and number of replies to online consultation
What are the next steps?
Following this, every 3 years, the Commission will report on progress made in the implementation of the Recommendation.
In addition the Commission will also produce a report on 'The State of Confidence in Vaccines in the EU', to monitor attitudes towards vaccination, in the context of the State of Health in the EU process.

Member of the Commission. - I can only agree with the honourable Member.
This is exactly the reason why we put forward this regulation.
I must say we were amazed by the number of applications received.
We were expecting a few hundred and we received 44 000 claims.
We consolidated this 44 000 into a group of 4 000, which we submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for an opinion.
That is the reason why EFSA is not in a position to complete the examination of all 4 000 claims within the time limit of December 2010.
But I think it is very important for the consumers that we finish this process and that they know exactly when they see a claim, and they see some food in the supermarket with a claim, they will know for sure that this is based on science and is not misleading.
(SV) To create market access means abolishing tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade around the world.
It is an immensely important priority for the Union's trade policy.
It creates not only business opportunities for European companies but also gives them access to better and cheaper products in other parts of the world.
It creates prosperity across the world.
It is also a matter on which I feel there is unaccustomed agreement in the European Parliament.
It is gratifying at a time when protectionism is on the march all around the world.
I therefore also think that the Commission Communication and Mr Guardans Cambó's report are more welcome than at any other time. They are really very good.
In this discussion I would like to draw attention to another question which we must not ignore - the other side of openness. I think that they belong together.
European firms also need openness within Europe in order to be competitive on a global basis and make use of the market access which we can create in other countries.
In our globalised world, with ever more companies having global supply chains, our own tariffs can be just as damaging to our successful businesses as those tariffs we oppose in other countries.
I have a concrete proposal for the Commissioner, a proposal which may help a little in resolving this question.
When firms have problems trading within the EU they report them to Solvit, which is an excellent tool for increasing mobility on the internal market.
If a firm has a problem exporting to a country outside the EU, it refers it to the Market Access Database.
That too is immensely important.
Both of these systems provide a basis for negotiations on how trade can be facilitated.
Let us hope that we can also develop either the Market Access Database or Solvit in order to deal with problems which importing firms in the EU may experience.
If we do that, both we ourselves and the rest of the world can continue to move in a direction which is more conducive to free trade.
Then we can show that Europe is taking the lead in opening up markets, both abroad and at home.
(FI) Mr President, the talks on membership between the EU and Turkey are a long process.
It is understandable that membership negotiations should raise many questions and even doubts.
Turkey's possible membership would alter Europe's borders politically, culturally, economically and strategically, though not geographically.
Turkey is and will remain an Asian country geographically: just a small part of Istanbul is on the European side.
Patience is now needed.
We have to take our time to wait and see how Turkey develops and how it meets the membership criteria.
It will not be easy for Turkey to adapt to all the changes quickly.
The decision on EU membership for Finland more than 10 years ago was a tough one, and that has been the case for all the other new Member States.
For Turkey it is far, far harder, as the EU requires so many changes.
Turkey is not ready to join now, but we have to admit that neither is the EU ready at present to accept Turkey as a member.
The time is not ripe.
A lot is being asked of the people and the decision-makers on the path towards agreement.
For enlargement to succeed, however, our own internal development also needs attention. The fate of the Constitutional Treaty is therefore important.
Minister Lehtomäki has done some excellent work.
She has held talks with all the Member States, and I would have liked her on this occasion to shed a little light on these discussions here in Parliament.
Openness is the only way for the Constitutional Treaty to come into force in some shape or form in the future.
Brussels, 28 June 2000
Commissioner Nielson attends follow-up to UN Social Summit
This Summit will provide the opportunity to take stock and reflect upon what has been achieved so far.
Whilst progress in some areas has been encouraging, much needs to be done on several issues such as the challenges posed by globalisation.
Mr Nielson will stress that the "follow-up and implementation of the Copenhagen Programme of Action need to be further strengthened and made more result oriented in order to respond to the diverse challenges of sustainable social development in a globalising world".
He will also meet representatives from Civil Society, NGOs and international bodies to exchange views on social development, and will take part in a series of workshops and meetings.
The Special Session is entitled "World Summit for Social Development and beyond: achieving social development for all in a globalising world".
The overarching objective is to keep social development at the heart of the global political agenda.
Mr Nielson will point out that the Copenhagen agenda is about more than portraying poverty as just low income: Links are made between poverty, environment and gender.
However, political responsibility of governments is a key factor.
It has to imply an honest dialogue among development partners about how to ensure that aid target priorities are set by the end beneficiaries.
The Copenhagen agenda is therefore an inclusive one.
Some of the negative aspects of globalisation are being felt in the developing world, where - as a result of low economic growth, debt burden and violent conflicts - poverty reduction efforts have suffered.
Mr Nielson acknowledges that meeting the goals of the Social Summit is an on-going process.
The European Community has recognised the Copenhagen objectives, strengthened by the Amsterdam Treaty which entered into force in May 1999, as priorities both at a European level and in its external policies, especially as regards developing countries and Least Developed Countries.
These are areas where important new initiatives have been taken at European Union level since the Copenhagen Summit.
The March 2000 Lisbon European Council marked a further breakthrough in the EU's drive to strengthen employment, economic reform and social cohesion.
The Copenhagen objectives are also important for the relations of the European Community with developing countries and the Least Developed Countries.
This strategy is designed to foster better complementarity between EU Member States, the European Community and other donors supporting macroeconomic reform and social programmes for health, education and gender equality.
The Copenhagen commitments have also been strengthened in the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement which was signed in Benin last week.
This agreement is based on the notion that combating poverty and placing human development at the centre are essential for sustainable development and for the integration of developing countries into the global economy.
These sheets provide an overview of recent developments and future priority areas of EC support.
Mr President, this week is undoubtedly an historically important one for the broader development of the European Union.
The European Parliament will vote on whether it supports the opening of accession talks between Turkey and the EU.
Leaders of the 25 governments of the European Union meeting in Brussels later this week will formally give the go-ahead – or not – to accession negotiations between the European Union and the Turkish Government.
Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this decision.
There is no acceptable middle ground when it comes to the issue of membership of the European Union.
A country is either a member of the European Union or it is not.
This is the crux of the matter.
I believe that a country seeking to join the European Union must clearly comply with all aspects of the Copenhagen criteria.
One must recall that the European Commission carried out an evaluation report on the progress that Turkey has made in its efforts to join the European Union.
In this report last October the Commission stated that the Turkish Government had brought forward a significant package of proposals this year which included the following: the abolition of State Security Courts, which would ensure that civil-military relations are brought into line with EU standards, the strengthening of the freedom of the press, the introduction of a constitutional clause on gender equality, and removal of all references to the death penalty.
In the last election my own party had a slogan which stated: 'A lot done, more to do'.
I believe that this is the case here.
More needs to be done, but a lot has been done and we must recognise that.
I support the terms of the today's report which states that the European Council should vote for accession negotiations with Turkey to begin without delay and the objective of these negotiations is Turkey's EU membership.
But there is also a realisation that further substantial political reforms are going to have to take place in Turkey before final accession negotiations can conclude.
It was intimated earlier in this debate that one of the reasons why Turkey should be kept out of the European Union is because Turkish people are not Christian.
Surely that flies in the face of the very thing that Christianity stands for.
Christianity is about being open and welcoming to people.
I believe that we should be open and welcoming and let these negotiations begin.

The new regulation on the labelling of tyres is part of the Community strategy on CO2, which sets targets to be achieved through vehicle emission reductions.
From November 2012, tyres will be labelled in the EU according to their fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise emissions.
Tyres are responsible for 20 to 30% of the energy consumed by vehicles due to their rolling resistance.
By regulating the use of energy efficient tyres that are safe and have low noise emissions, we are helping both to reduce environmental damage, by lowering fuel consumption, and to increase consumer protection, by means of market competition.
I therefore welcome the creation of another instrument that represents one more step in the direction of a sustainable Europe in terms of energy.
Brussels, 22 December 1999
Rover Group Ltd, situated in Bickenhill, Birmingham, is 100% owned by the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW.
The Rover 200 and 400 series are produced in Rover's Longbridge plant which is the largest car plant in the United Kingdom.
BMW has indicated that the alternative location for the project would be in Hungary.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot help noticing that the way in which negotiations were conducted by the Commission has failed to secure signature of genuine EPAs before the scheduled date.
Here I agree with Mr Sturdy: the interim agreements call into question the regional groups that had been created and formed the basis of discussions to sign these EPAs.
Far from strengthening links and trust between Europe and ACP states, negotiations have aroused great concern.
There is concern in relation to losses of public resources: the Senegalese President recently told the press that between 35% and 70% of African budgets were made up of customs tariffs: Nigeria is set to lose 800 million euros, for instance.
There is concern in relation to the consequences of liberalisation for fragile sectors of ACP economies, which will have to face competition from European businesses.
There is concern in relation to the requests to include a number of subjects in the second phase, which do not correspond to WTO obligations.
Here I am thinking of services, investment, public markets and the rules of competition.
There is concern in relation to the threat of introducing higher customs tariffs in 2008 for non-LDC ACP states as a kind of blackmail forcing them to accept any agreement.
I feel we need to give ACP-EU relations a new lease of life and get negotiations back on the tracks of the main Cotonou principles.
EPAs are development instruments.
Liberalisation is not an end in itself.
The aim of EPAs is to strengthen ACP economies to help them move into the world economy.
No ACP state should be worse off after an EPA than before it was signed.
The signatories must benefit from a preference system at least as favourable as before any EPA signature.
Agreements must be based on the interests of the ACP states and their economic diversification.
The rules of origin must be clarified to ascertain the extent to which they will benefit from any new market access measures we put forward, and genuine mechanisms for financial compensation must be implemented.
The message in the Kigali Declaration by members of parliament in ACP states and in Europe must be understood.
The date of 31 December is not as fatal a blow as the one you dealt.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Mr President, my British fellow Members sometimes use the expression 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'.
This is the way it should be!
Fruit and vegetables are normally healthy types of food, but unfortunately this is not always the case.
In far too many cases there are pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables and naturally this has direct negative consequences for human health.
The subject that we are concerned with here is therefore very important.
Consequently, it is very important that we use these substances in a sustainable manner, so that we can reduce their usage in those cases where we use too many pesticides.
Our nature, environment and health are being damaged, and groundwater sources may also be contaminated.
Therefore, I also believe there is reason to criticise the Commission, particularly because you, Mr Kyprianou, are known (in my country, too) as a man who is very concerned with consumer interests and have done a considerable amount to safeguard the environment and health.
I do not understand how you can stand here today and defend a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and will also force European countries to reduce their levels of consumer protection.
Allow me simply to give a couple of examples of what this will mean if we accept the proposal that you have put forward.
In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted.
We have reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s.
I am sure you will agree that this is a very sensible thing to do.
If your proposal is implemented, we will be forced to double the number of pesticides permitted in Denmark.
Double the number of pesticides!
This will probably mean that we will find it very difficult to continue drinking our groundwater untreated as we do today.
I do not view this issue purely as a national one.
I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
There are many examples.
In every single zone, it is of course the case that every country apart from one will be forced to approve pesticides that they do not currently approve.
Let me give an example of one crop: maize.
In the UK a maize pesticide is used that contains around 15 active substances.
In Hungary 57 active substances are used, while in Poland 37 are used.
However, if the Commission's proposals are implemented every country will therefore approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled.
It should not be the EU's task to force countries to use more pesticides.
It will affect the environment, it will affect health and it will affect groundwater.
Surely this cannot be the intention.
I hope that you will back up what we have proposed in the Committee on the Environment; this will also make life easier for the industry.
It is in the compromise that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment: we will say no to the mutual obligatory approval of pesticides, but yes to the mutual obligatory approval of data.
Moreover, we are talking not only about zones, but also about data throughout Europe.
This will make life much easier for the industry.
At the same time, we are actually giving countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so.
Finally, with regard to the reduction targets, I would like to say to Mr Dimas that it is unbelievably positive that we are getting rid of the most dangerous substances - substances that cause cancer, substances that affect child development, etc.
Naturally we would like to remove these substances from the market.
They are also completely unnecessary. In addition, I think that we should go a step further and also establish a general reduction target for all substances.
Of course this should be something that is determined individually in each country, but if we simultaneously link this with the European reduction targets of around 20%, I think we are being ambitious.
However, in spite of everything I still believe we are at a stage where it is possible.
It will be of great significance for health and the environment in Europe.
With regard to the justification that has been used by the Commission for not introducing these reduction targets, we have introduced a treatment frequency index that takes account of the points that you have otherwise emphasised.
European Investment Bank provides largest ever investment in Africa – EUR 240m loan to fund private and PPP infrastructure projects in Nigeria
The European Investment Bank (EIB) today signed the Nigeria Framework Loan which will provide up to EUR 240m to three Nigerian banks: FirstBank of Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank and Stanbic IBTC.
The funding will be used to facilitate private and public private partnership infrastructure in the country and ensure continued investment in the sector.
The Nigeria Framework Loan represents the largest single investment by the European Investment Bank, the long-term lending institution of the European Union.
“Nigeria has specific needs in infrastructure and the Nigeria Framework Loan will make a considerable contribution to improving infrastructure in the country.
We look forward to working closely with three of the strongest banks in Nigeria to increase infrastructure finance in the country, following regulatory reforms and transformation of the banking sector.
The three banks should be commended for their leadership in governance, transparency and risk management” said Plutarchos Sakellaris, European Investment Bank Vice-President responsible for sub-Saharan Africa, speaking at the signing ceremony in Lagos, Nigeria.
Vice President Sakellaris is currently on a week long visit to Nigeria and the signature follows meetings with Vice President Goodluck Jonathan, Ministers of Finance, Petroleum, Power, and National Planning and the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as European Ambassadors and members of the local business community.
The Nigeria Framework Loan will focus in infrastructure projects that promote economic development, foster private sector development and create a competitive business environment.
These could include among others, projects in the energy, power, transport and telecommunications sectors, and associated manufacturing industries.
In 2009, the European Investment Bank provided over EUR 1.1bn [USD 1.5 bn] of funding to sub-Saharan Africa.
The Bank provides a broad range of financing instruments including loans, guarantees and risk capital to Africa selecting projects that can deliver sustainable economic, social and environmental benefits.

Notes for editors:
The European Investment Bank, the long-term lending institution of the European Union, whose shareholders are the 27 European Union member states, has been active across Africa for over 40 years.
EIB activities follow policies and objectives set down by European Union member states and whose Finance Ministers are the EIB’s Governors.
The three partner banks have a track record of strong financial performance and have undertaken major steps to follow international governance, transparency and risk management best-practice.
The Bank also supports public sector projects that are critical for private sector development and the creation of a competitive business environment.
FirstBank has been active since the first long-term loan to the then Colonial Government in 1947 and has continued to play a leading role in the financing of long-term development of the Nigerian economy (notably Econet Wireless, NITEL Switching facility and Nigeria's largest loan syndication to Dangote Group)."
Nobody here in plenary noticed, and that is why I told you that.
However, if you feel it is necessary, we shall be happy to vote on it.

El Salvador: Actions following the earthquake.
The burial in a landslide of Las Colinas, a neighbourhood close to the capital city of San Salvador, was the most dramatic result of this new tragedy.
The death toll has risen above 700, 2000 have been declared missing and more than 4000 have been injured.
More than 200.000 houses have been destroyed totally or partially, around 800 public buildings, including 11 hospitals, have been damaged and hundreds of thousands have been evacuated.

The EU responded immediately and massively to the catastrophe.
Most of the Member States and the Commission provided emergency relief in kind or financial aid (€ ±10 million) during the first days, counting for roughly 61% of the total international aid effort.
The European Commission provided an immediate response to the earthquake through its Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO).
On the basis of their findings, strategic guidelines were sent to potential partners and it is expected that a new decision will be adopted in the following weeks, once the selection of the proposals submitted is completed.
In addition, the San Vicente housing programme, originally designed to provide 800 houses for demobilised fighters, has been expanded to cover some of the needs created by the earthquake and will now help construct a total of 2000 houses.
Finally, the Commission has financial resources are available for the purchase and distribution of seeds, tools and other agricultural inputs.
These resources can be mobilised as soon requests are submitted by NGOs present in the El Salvador.
Future EU action
For the period 1993-2000, the EU was one of the principle sources of official Development aid for El Salvador.
Background:
EU assistance to El Salvador has focussed on rebuilding and national reconciliation, with the implementation of projects of rural development, of democratisation, of training and of supporting demobilisation of soldiers and militia.
The total amount envisaged for financial and technical aid and economic co-operation for the period 2000-2006 is € 60 million.
Concerning the Rebuilding Programme of Central America post Mitch (PRRAC), out of a total of € 256 million, € 28.5 million are earmarked for El Salvador.
Of the € 28.5 million, € 10 million are included in the first financing agreement, which was signed in 2000.
An additional € 5.1 million are included in the 2nd financing agreement, which is in the process of signature.
Those funds are earmarked for a number of sectors (education, health, water supply and sanitation) and sub-projects already identified.

Commissioner Monti launches competition dialogue with China
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti signed with the ministerial authorities responsible for the drafting of the new Chinese competition law a declaration, which marks the beginning of a competition policy dialogue between the European Commission and the Chinese authorities.
It is the first time that China has embarked on such a dialogue.
A meeting with Vice Premier Mrs. Wu Yi is scheduled for Tuesday 25 November.
In a ceremony Commissioner Monti and the Head of the Ministry of Commerce signed a declaration marking the start of an EU-China competition dialogue.
It is the first time that China has embarked on such a dialogue.
I am therefore very pleased that we can start a dialogue in this important policy area, which is crucial to balanced governance of globalisation.
The European Commission has a long-standing tradition in competition enforcement and is willing to share its experience with the Chinese authorities.'
Commissioner Monti's visit to China was preceded by the first high level meeting with the Japanese competition authorities on Thursday and Friday after the signature in July of a bilateral co-operation agreement between the EU and Japan on competition policy.
The European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed acquisition of Alstom by Siemens, under the EU Merger Regulation.
The Commission is concerned that the merger may reduce competition in the supply of several types of trains and signalling systems.
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: "
Trains and the signalling equipment that guide them are essential for transport in Europe.
The Commission will investigate whether the proposed acquisition of Alstom by Siemens would deprive European rail operators of a choice of suppliers and innovative products, and lead to higher prices, which could ultimately harm the millions of Europeans who use rail transportation every day for work or leisure."
Siemens and Alstom are global leaders in rail transportation.
Both companies have a wide product portfolio and compete in tenders for the manufacture and supply of:
The proposed transaction would combine the two largest suppliers of rolling stock and signalling solutions in the European Economic Area (EEA) not only in terms of size of the combined operations, but also in terms of geographic footprint of their activities.
The Commission's competition concerns
At this stage, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction would reduce competition in the markets where the merged entity would be active.
In particular, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction could lead to higher prices, less choice and less innovation due to reduced competitive pressure in rolling stock and signalling tenders.
This would be to the detriment of train operators, infrastructure managers and ultimately European passengers who use trains and metros on a daily basis.
More specifically, the Commission's initial investigation found that:
For rolling stock, the proposed transaction would remove a very strong competitor and reduce the number of suppliers.
In relation to high speed trains, the Commission has examined the impact of the transaction both within the EEA and on a worldwide basis (excluding China, Japan and Korea which appear to have barriers preventing imports from foreign suppliers).
On both of these geographic markets, the merged entity would be the undisputed market leader, over three times larger than the closest competitor.
For signalling solutions, the proposed transaction would remove a very strong competitor from several mainline and urban signalling markets.
The Commission will now carry out an in-depth investigation into the effects of the transaction to determine whether its initial competition concerns are confirmed.
Companies and products
Merger control rules and procedures:
The vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review.
From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).
In addition to the current transaction, there are four ongoing Phase II merger investigations: the proposed acquisition of Solvay's nylon business by BASF, the proposed acquisition of Tele2 NL by T-Mobile NL, the proposed acquisition of Shazam by Apple and the proposed merger of Praxair and Linde.
More information will be available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number M.8677.

in writing. - I voted in favour of this report for the reason that a renewed economic and social approach with regard to the management, allocation and utilisation of the spectrum should be adopted.
Particular focus should be directed towards the formulation of regulation which ensures greater spectrum efficiency, better frequency planning and safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour and the taking of anti-social measures with regards to the usage of the spectrum.
As highlighted in the Single Market Act, the establishment of a radio spectrum programme is key for the enhancement of the digital society and the development of technology.
I believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach towards the proper coordination of the management of the spectrum across the EU in view of the fact that this public good is a scarce and finite resource and is crucial to the furtherance of consumers, citizens and businesses within the single market.

Commissioner Piebalgs welcomes political agreement on the Energy Labelling Directive
With these words Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs welcomed the outcome of the last trialogue held by Council, Parliament and Commission.
Thank you for your remark.
If such an event has indeed taken place, we will adopt the same position as you have suggested.
Thank you for calling attention to this.
Brussels, 23 October 2003
The European Commission has decided to refer to the Italian competition authorities the examination of the proposed acquisition of Italian tobacco company Ente Tabacchi Italiani by British American Tobacco.
BAT (British American Tobacco) is an international tobacco company active in the manufacturing, marketing and sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products globally.
ETI is Italy's second-largest tobacco company in Italy after Philip Morris.
PRESS RELEASE No° 76/09
Judgments of the Court of First Instance in Case T-183/07 and in Case T-263/07
THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE ANNULS THE COMMISION DECISIONS CONCERNING THE NATIONAL ALLOCATION PLANS (NAPS) OF POLAND AND ESTONIA FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION ALLOWANCES
In order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner, the 2003 Directive 1 establishes a Community scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community.
The Directive provides that, for each five-year period, each Member State is to develop a national allocation plan (NAP) stating the total quantity of allowances that it intends to allocate for that period and how it proposes to allocate them.
The plan is to be based on objective and transparent criteria, including the criteria listed in the Directive, taking due account of comments from the public.
It is to be published and notified to the Commission and to the other Member States.
If the NAP is incompatible with the criteria listed in the Directive, the Commission may reject it or any aspect of it.
In 2006 the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Estonia notified the Commission of their NAPs for the period from 2008 to 2012.
18)
2 From 284.648332 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ( MteCO 2 ) to 208.515395 MteCO 2 per year.
3 From 24.375045 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ( MteCO 2 ) to 12.717058 MteCO 2 per year.
Thereafter, Poland, supported by Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia, and Estonia, supported by Lithuania and Slovakia, brought actions for annulment of the Commission decisions relating to them, the Commission for its part being supported by the United Kingdom.
Misuse of powers
The Court states in that regard that Member States have a margin for manoeuvre in deciding the method which they adopt in order to draw up their NAP for allowances.
Accordingly, the Commission is authorised to verify the conformity of the NAP notified by the Member State with the criteria set out in the Directive and to reject that plan on the grounds of incompatibility with those criteria and provisions, by reasoned decision.
Next, the Court holds in essence that by rejecting the NAP on the basis of reasoning which consists only in the evocation of doubts as to the reliability of the data used by Estonia and Poland, the Commission erred in law.
Furthermore, where the Commission decides to reject the notified NAP, it cannot claim to set aside the data in the NAP in question so as to replace them at the outset by data obtained from its own assessment method.
By claiming that, by virtue of the principle of equal treatment, it is for the Commission to select and apply a single method for assessing the NAPs of all the Member States in order to achieve the objective pursued by the Directive, the Commission exceeded the margin for manoeuvre conferred upon it by the Directive.
The Court observes that to allow the Commission to use a single method of assessing NAPs for all the Member States would amount to acknowledging it as having not only a veritable power of uniformisation in the context of implementing the allowance trading system, but also a central role in the drawing up of NAPs.
Neither such a power of uniformisation nor such a central role were conferred on the Commission by the legislature, in the context of its power of reviewing NAPs.
Further, it is for each Member State, not the Commission, to decide, on the basis of its NAP drawn up in accordance with the Directive, on the total quantity of allowances it will allocate for the period in question, to initiate the process of allocation of those allowances to the operator of each installation and to rule on allocation of those allowances.
Consequently, by imposing in the contested decisions allowance ceilings above which the NAP would be regarded as incompatible with the assessment criteria, the Commission substituted itself, in practice, for the Member States concerned.
The infringement of the duty to state reasons
The Court, concerning Poland, states that it is the duty of the Commission, in the exercise of its power of review, to explain in what way the instruments used by a Member State in drawing up the NAP are, in its opinion, incompatible with the criteria in the Directive.
In the present case, having regard to the burden of proof incumbent upon it, the Commission has not provided anything in the contested decision capable of sufficiently explaining in what way the choice of the method of economic analysis and the data used by Poland were contrary to Community law.
The infringement of the principle of sound administration
In that context, the Court holds that the information contained in the Court’s file does not appear to be reconcilable with the conclusion reached by the Commission in the contested decision, according to which the allowances contained in the reserves in question were not included in the total quantity of allowances to be allocated.
The Court holds that the Commission did not properly examine the NAP submitted by Estonia and, consequently, infringed the principle of sound administration.
Accordingly, the Court of First Instance annuls the Commission decisions concerning the NAPs of the Republics of Poland and Estonia.
REMINDER: An appeal, limited to points of law only, may be brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities against a decision of the Court of First Instance, within two months of its notification.

They will ensure that their national Policies conform to this Common Position.
The European Union takes note of this commitment and welcomes it.
* Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.
There remains, however, the question of the reserve, Mr Virrankoski.
We do not have to vote on the first part, but a vote must be taken on the second part, that is to say the reserve.
(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.
I too would like to welcome Mrs Cecilia Malmström and Commissioner Barrot.
I am also delighted with this proposal that has been put forward.
As a former Hungarian Foreign Minister, I have worked very hard together with others to bring the Western Balkan countries closer to the European Union and make them take the next step on the path to accession.
We also know that, from this perspective, visa-free travel is the thing which people perhaps understand and feel the most.
It now paves the way for them to enjoy freedom of movement and to form closer human relationships.
Perhaps it will also help with what I think we all consider important, which is sustaining the motivation of these countries during the very difficult process which accession entails.
We know that some very serious steps must be taken.
Very often, certain traditions need to be transcended which we know it is not easy to transcend.
It is very important that the three countries are now given visa-free travel.
I would also like to draw your attention to a view which has been voiced many times today, namely, that the balance in the Western Balkan countries is very delicate.
There were already ethnic tensions before the war, but they have still remained following the war.
We must therefore assess every kind of measure from the perspective of whether it will decrease or increase these tensions.
In the case of Bosnia, as has been mentioned several times today, this decision is not only beneficial and important because Bosnia has now been left out, but also because a large number of Bosnian citizens who have a Croatian or Serbian passport will enjoy visa-free travel, while the remainder will not.
The same situation applies to Kosovan citizens too, so that anyone who can obtain their passport in Serbia will enjoy visa-free travel.
I believe that it is important for us to emphasise once again that a political decision must be made, not only a technical one.
For this reason, it is our responsibility to help these countries achieve visa-free travel as soon as possible, within a very specific timeframe.
(DA) Commissioner, you say that in 2012, you will present a report in which you will reach a conclusion as to whether there are grounds to revise the legislation on account of the fact that it does not take account of cocktail effects.
In this respect, I can save you the trouble, as we are already now able to confirm that this is the case.
The legislation does not take account of cocktail effects.
Those of us who have worked on REACH and those who know REACH in detail - as I know you do - know only too well that cocktail effects have simply not been taken into account when it comes to the most hazardous substances: carcinogenic substances and endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
Moreover, REACH is based on two fundamental principles: the precautionary principle and the principle of protecting the most vulnerable consumers in our market, in other words, children and pregnant women, among others.
So, should the Commission not present proposals now for revising REACH and perhaps also other types of legislation in order to stipulate that cocktail effects must be taken into account in the authorisation process on the basis of the substitution principle?
Brussels, 28 January 2009
Nano2012 is aimed at developing new technologies to design and produce the next generation of integrated circuits.
Following an in-depth examination of the aid granted to STMicroelectronics for Nano2012, the Commission concluded that the aid was compatible with the Community guidelines on state aid for research, development and innovation (see IP/06/1600).
The programme will generate positive externalities in terms of dissemination of knowledge.
It is thus designed to compensate for market failure and will have only a limited impact on competition.
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “
Its positive effects will far outweigh any distortion of competition that may result from the aid.”
Under Nano2012, STMicroelectronics will launch the development of new technologies to design and produce the next generation of integrated circuits.
Under this scheme, aid over and above a certain amount must be notified individually to the Commission.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under case number N 437/2008 in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.
New publications of state aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the online newsletter State aid Weekly e-News.
Mr President, I note with satisfaction that the European Parliament has more strength and vitality behind it than ever.
There have been a very high number of interventions, specific questions, which would be impossible to deal with completely in my response, without prolonging this session entirely unacceptably.
Allow me to make a compromise and to refer in my intervention to certain questions which I think are most relevant and must be clarified.
My compromise is that each and every one of the specific questions which have been raised by members will get a response at the final sitting that I attend at the end of the six-month period, when Spain's rotating Presidency will be assessed and judged.
I therefore hope to satisfy all Members on certain specific matters, which I have taken note of.
Allow me to say a few words about the interventions of my compatriots, the Spanish MEPs.
I wish to thank the Spanish Partido Popular for the support it has shown at this sitting, which was confirmed in the national political debate and endorsed through a motion.
This is undoubtedly an extraordinarily positive factor for the job in hand, and highlights our shared European desire, the combined effort and the work that we are prepared to continue to do focused on the very difficult times we are living through as we confront the economic crisis.
I wish to refer to immigration.
One of the honourable Members highlighted the question of what our immigration policy is and even said that no reference had been made to it.
It is true that there was no reference to it in my speech but, in short, one has to prioritise.
It has been expressly stated that I am in favour of mass immigration and that is categorically not true.
What I am in favour of is respecting the human rights of all, of every single person, wherever they may come from.
(Applause)
We have a European pact on immigration, promoted and endorsed during the French Presidency.
We must abide by that pact and, of course, that pact includes border controls, cooperation and political dialogue with the countries the immigrants come from, as the best way of avoiding a massive flow of immigrants.
However, I must add that integration forms part of the policy of the European immigration pact, integration in respect of the human rights of immigrants.
I speak on behalf of a country which has, in the last few years, experienced very intense levels of immigration, but not in vain, as, since the year 2000, the Spanish population has increased by six million people.
It has also had experience of emigration since, at the time of the dictatorship, there was economic emigration to many European countries.
We well know, through experience, what it is to have to leave your own country in search of a future or some shred of economic dignity.
We know that it is difficult to swallow and we know that countries and nations are not measured purely by their political, military or economic power.
Nations, along with Europe, are also measured by their treatment of and respect for human rights and for the people who come to work in our lands in search of a future which they cannot have in their own.
(Applause)
Furthermore, the European Union must be aware - as indeed it is - that by 2025, 30% of its population will be over 65 years of age.
This will not occur in any other area or region of the world.
We will be the area, the continent with the greatest number of people over 65, and this will result in a decline in our capacity to produce, a decline in the active population and in labour capacity, and this will put pressure on our social protection systems.
In the medium term, Europe needs workers.
Beyond the crisis, it will need workers, it needs to get women into the jobs market and it needs that increase in the active population in order to maintain social protection.
This is a fundamental conclusion.
Secondly, subsidiarity and languages.
Of course, we will be faithful in our application of the Lisbon Treaty, and I would like to point out that it was my government that promoted the use of Spanish co-official languages in the European institutions.
There is no doubt, however, that at the moment, balance between the institutions is highlighted in the application of the Treaty of Lisbon.
There has been some comment, which I believe to be unfair, although I must admit that it has been very isolated in nature.
As the President of the rotating Presidency, I have expressed, declared and supported the institutional role of the permanent President of the Council, of course, the High Representative, and the full collaboration of the Commission, and I will continue to do so.
The new powers of the European Parliament will be set in motion by the rotating Spanish Presidency, in full collaboration with the President of the Commission, who has always demonstrated his continuous working relationship with Parliament.
I refer to the work carried out by Mr Durão Barroso.
I have been criticised for giving him my support.
Yes, I have supported him and I do support him, because I have seen him work in favour of a strong and united Europe, and that is very important, over and above ideological positioning.
Thirdly, the financial system, tax havens and new regulation and supervision.
I did not refer to this so as not to exhaust all subjects, but I fully agree with the application of the rules on new financial supervision and regulation.
As for the requirement to put an end to tax havens, the rotating Presidency will be firm and strict.
(Applause)
It will, of course, promote, encourage and demand all countries to push forward with the necessary agreements for fiscal transparency and for the provision of information in the context of the international community.
On the subject of climate change, on 11 February the Council will carry out an analysis of the Copenhagen Summit, with the help of the Commission.
Of course, the European Union should continue to take steps in favour of a strategy which will bring us to a progressive agreement to promote the reduction of climate change.
I am in favour of the European Union knowing how to intelligently align its own ambition, which it has laid down for 2020 or for the period 2020-2030, with the demands of other players with regard to reducing their emissions.
In support of European unity and a common strategy, we must entrust this task to the European Commission.
I also fully agree that the United States and China are the two lead players for whom we can see a much more active role.
Of course, I am fully convinced that the common agriculture policy should include fisheries and that the social pact which was referred to by some Members needs revision, a change to incorporate the interests, legitimate representation and the constructive position of a large proportion of those who represent workers in Europe.
They represent the workers, the unions that are the expression of the European social pact which, in the last few decades, has made us the region with the greatest social welfare and the greatest prosperity since the Second World War.
(Applause)
The future of the European Union and European prosperity cannot be written down without the workers, without social rights and without social welfare policies and therefore, we must actively incorporate them.
There was a question concerning the area of foreign policy.
The Middle East, Latin America in particular, and an allusion to Israel.
We hope in the next six months to push forward an agreement on the Middle East.
We know that peace in the Middle East is a necessary, fundamental condition for peace in other regions, where terror and conflict have spread, driven by radicalism and ideological and religious fanaticism.
The European Union will fulfil its role by contributing to that peace process through a commitment to take up talks again.
We know what the aims and the conditions are.
We know that that dialogue must include the recognition of the Palestinian State as one of its fundamental conditions.
(Applause)
To work with Israel is to work for peace.
If we do not work with Israel, in spite of the criticisms that it deserves for many of its actions, we will not be able to see peace on the horizon.
To work with Palestine is to work for its right to a state, a territory, to be able to see prosperity on the horizon and to deal with all the outstanding issues.
We will do this in a determined manner and, of course, with the collaboration of other major international players.
Regarding Latin America. Latin America is a young, immensely vital continent, with a great future.
It has a population of 500 million people and has a great European imprint, not just a great Spanish imprint, but a great European imprint because, over there, democratic values and progressive values now exist, after a long time, and some difficulties consolidating what its stability and its consolidation as a group of nations mean.
At the Latin American Summit, we wish to achieve or make progress towards trade agreements with Mercosur, with Central America and with the Andean Community.
This is all in the interests of development and progress, for Latin America as much as for European economic interests, which, in my opinion should also be defended.
European interests.
When reference was made, and agreed on by other Members, to Union policies on equality between men and women, I considered this to be a very good example and a policy of citizenship.
Those are European interests.
The European interests I uphold in foreign policy action are the interests involving the values of what Europe represents, which has its origins in the Enlightenment and in all the cultural, religious and civic traditions that have flourished and developed in Europe.
To standardise is to tolerate, to standardise is to respect European tradition, the best of European tradition, which means that this land is the land of religious, ideological, political and cultural freedom.
That freedom demands tolerance and equality of treatment between all faiths and beliefs, so that democracy can be complete democracy.
(Applause)
Mr President, I basically wanted to refer to some isolated interventions, about my country, about Spain, from other countries, and particularly Mr Langen's reference, a particular reference to Spain, about our economic characteristics, which I feel obliged to answer.
I must say that when I began my speech this morning, I spoke as a European country, as a pro-European country, thankful to be in the European Union, thankful to those countries who encouraged our entry into the European Union, and having experienced a great transformation and great progress in these past 25 years.
So much so, that since we entered the European Union, we have reduced the difference in per capita income by 15 points, exceeding the current European average.
This has been thanks to the efforts of many Spaniards, of its workers and its enterprises.
Currently, after making such significant progress, we are experiencing the economic crisis, which is affecting employment.
It is true that we have a high level of unemployment, as happened during the crises of the 70s and 90s.
This has been a characteristic of our country, just as when there is growth, we create more employment than other countries.
However, I can assure Mr Langen, if the rate of unemployment should increase in his country tomorrow, whoever may be governing it, my response as a political leader, as Prime Minister and as a pro-European, would be one of support and solidarity, and not one of recrimination, which was your response in this House this morning.
(Applause)
It would be a response of support and solidarity.
That is my way of feeling and being European, with the admiration I hold for your country, and I hope this does not happen.
In short, Mr President, we will work during this Presidency towards a European project of solidarity, of cooperation, of more economic union, of reforms and of convictions.
I thank you for your references to Mr Almunia, amongst other reasons, because he was proposed by me for the responsibilities he undertakes.
We also know that in the next six months, Parliament can count on the collaboration, respect and appreciation of my country and my government and that, at the end of this Presidency, I will be here, I will be held to account exhaustively and I will answer any questions that may come up with respect and solidarity.
(Applause)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Petya Stavreva on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0051/2009 -,
the report by Eugenijus Maldeikis on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy - C6-0049/2009 - and
the report by Reimer Böge on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management as regards the multiannual financial framework - C6-0508/2008 -.
Thank you for that answer, Commissioner Byrne.
I also thank you for all the work that you have done over the past five years on the public health agenda.
It is much appreciated.
As you said, new research suggests that in some cases, one in a hundred babies could be affected.
Other research suggests that the figure is one in three hundred.
In fact, according to Friday's , which dealt with what is happening in France, about 7 000 babies born there are thought to be mentally or physically damaged by passive consumption of alcohol in the womb.
Mr Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Minister for Health, said that FAS was 'aside from genetic factors, the prime cause of mental retardation in children'.
This is clearly a European issue and one that we have to take seriously.
I hope that the Commission's alcohol strategy will look at what is happening in the United States of America, where alcohol products are properly labelled with a health warning.
Commissioner, how can we make the possibility a reality?
.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that we have had to discuss the terrible case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and take note of China’s unwillingness to go down the road of reconciliation.
Far from it: no more than before is he guaranteed a transparent and fair trial, and what is even worse is that torture and the inhumane conditions under which he is incarcerated – without, let it be noted, due process of law – have now brought him to the point where his life is in danger, and this is something about which we absolutely must speak out, and not for the first time.
We in this House owe it to ourselves to take action now, for we have already demanded fair treatment for this man who is almost at the point of death, and whose only crime was to be a beloved teacher and spiritual guide.
Now is the time for us to take action and press anew our demands on the Chinese Government.
What makes this all the more necessary is that it would appear that, the greater the appetite the Member States and their governments have for the Chinese market, the more cautious they are about raising human rights issues with their Chinese partners in dialogue.
At a time like this and in a context such as this, we owe it to ourselves to defend our values.
It is we Members of this House who must do what our governments are failing to do.
In a situation in which Tibet is autonomous only on paper and not in reality, in which the dialogue with the Dalai Lama, having begun so promisingly, is either not continued or deferred again and again, and in which China still does not guarantee human rights, we must speak up and speak out, demanding that this state of affairs be brought to an end and that order be restored.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, overall the report by Mrs Andrikienreport is an excellent report, which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard on to provide ideas of the utmost value.
Human rights have constituted one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union since its creation and respect for them is an essential point that the European Parliament must encourage every day.
Wider acceptance of human and fundamental rights, globalisation and changes in our society require a new and different outlook that does not fit any of our existing canons.
It therefore becomes essential to guarantee equal access to natural resources, as one of the fundamental rights of each individual.
In the coming years, climate change will lead to an enormous number of refugees fleeing the poorest areas of the Earth and it is our duty to begin to take note of these potential migratory flows so that we can establish appropriate policies that will enable respect for the dignity of these people to be guaranteed.
The expression 'climate refugee' has not yet entered the vocabulary of current international law.
Naturally, we remain committed to the fight against desertification, just as we do to adjusting to climate change.
These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report, so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues.
(FR) Mr Barroso, the Lisbon Strategy has had its day.
The European Union will therefore not be the most competitive economy from 1 January.
Please excuse my harsh words, but one can almost talk in terms of a mirage.
What we need to do now is ensure that, for the years ahead, for 2010, the EU is more like an oasis of calm for Europe's entrepreneurs and citizens.
In this connection, I read in the memo with which you have presented us that you are talking about internationalising SMEs, the main creators of jobs in the EU.
Do you not think, Mr Barroso, that the urgent requirement today is to stabilise the situation, to reassure people?
Moreover, can you guarantee today that the Commission will oppose any regulatory hysteria and will apply, on a daily basis and in all its policies, the principle, the strategy, 'Think small first'?

Declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on Burundi: Arusha peace process
The European Union welcomes the continuing talks within the Arusha peace process, intended to find a peaceful solution to the conflict within Burundi.
The European Union considers this process as an essential option for reaching agreement.
It has taken note of the resolve of the Government of Burundi, declared on several occasions, to conclude negotiations successfully in 1999.
Regional states, by suspending their embargo against Burundi in January 1999, signalled their support for the talks.
Nevertheless, the European Union is deeply concerned about reports of continued violence by rebel groups and the security forces, causing numerous civilian victims.
It appeals urgently to both sides to cease their acts of violence immediately.
Several EU Member States and the European Commission are providing financial support to the peace process.
After nine months of negotiations, the EU urges the parties to organise the talks in a way that will help to achieve the desired result as soon as possible.
On such a basis, the EU Member States and the European Commission are willing to consider favourably further financial support and appeal to other donors to act likewise.
The European Union is providing substantial support to Burundi.
In response to positive political steps and in order to promote development in Burundi, the EU has expressed its willingness to assist in a more long-term manner to socio-economic rehabilitation and reconstruction.
The EU underlines that such support is linked to a successful pursuance and accomplishment of the peace process.
The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, the associated country Cyprus and the EFTA countries, members of the European Economic Area align themselves with this declaration.
I welcome the outcome of the European Council, especially the important decision made to support Greece, in cooperation with the IMF.
This is an important step towards strengthening European solidarity.
Greece is not the only State in the euro area facing financial problems.
Structural reforms and restoring macroeconomic stability through reallocating budget resources to support sustainable growth are more pertinent than direct aid.
The European Union needs a new, medium-term strategic vision for growth and development, combined with the prudent collection and redistribution of financial resources.
Two fundamental reforms need to be added - the reform of the CAP and the reform of the cohesion policy, two budget items absorbing a large volume of resources.
Increasing employment, boosting competitiveness and productivity, along with exceptionally productive investments in research and innovation are the main measures for halting the decline and kick-starting sustainable growth, which are key objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy.
. Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome to the House today the Presidents of the European Council and of the Commission, and I gather that the President of the European Council will also be present when the Commission unveils its programme in Brussels on 26 January.
I see that as a splendid symbol for the ever-growing cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Future presidencies should take that as an example to follow.
Although we were very pleased to see the President of the Commission and the President of the Council in Asia, visiting Jakarta as an expression of the European Union’s solidarity, I would like to emphasise that, however necessary solidarity with the stricken areas might be, we must not overlook the great problems in Africa and in other parts of the world.
We have to consider how we can, in so far as we are able, take preventive measures, in the shape of an early warning system, in Europe too, for example in the Mediterranean.
We are very much behind you, Mr President of the Council, in what you had to say about the Community method.
Luxembourg may well be small in geographical terms, but it is a Grand Duchy and hence a great country, and the Benelux states’ presidencies have always been excellent ones.
We wish you great success; for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats too, the Constitution is of the utmost priority.
In Brussels, we will have in-depth discussions on the Lisbon strategy, even though making the European economy competitive is not an end in itself, for the fact is that a strong economy is the best guarantee of good social policy.
We see competitiveness as being about creating more jobs in Europe by way of growth and better conditions for European businesses.
For us, that is social policy in the true sense of the word.
Rather than setting ecology and the protection of the environment against the economy, we need a sensible balance between them.
We also wish you and your presidency success in handling the financial perspective.
To those ladies and gentlemen – in this instance, no doubt, only gentlemen – who wrote letters arguing in favour of the 1% limit, we would say that you cannot enlarge Europe and then refuse the EU’s new Member States the money that is an expression of our solidarity, and which they need in order to be brought up to our standards.
To do that, we in the European Union need the necessary funding to be made available.
You have mentioned the treaties that are to be signed, but how, in the absence of any agreement by June and of any success in medium-term financial planning, are we to cope with the accession of new states to the European Union?
We are very glad that it is Reimer Böge, a very competent member of our group, who will be writing the report for this House.
You also made reference to the Stability Pact.
I am very grateful to you for what you said, and I can agree with every word of it.
What you said boils down, in essence, to the need for more flexibility.
The thing about flexibility is that it is those states that have made provisions that have more of it.
To come to the point, then, the less indebted a state is, the more flexible it can be when times are hard for the economy, which also means that we have to do what has to be done to reduce deficits when things are going well for the economy, for we know that today’s debts always end up being tomorrow’s taxes, and a burden on the public as a whole, particularly on the younger generation.
Let me just say something briefly about foreign policy issues, a number of which you have addressed, and – as I understand it – the President of the Commission is in full agreement with what you said.
Our support for Ukraine is only just beginning and will have to be an ongoing responsibility.
If I may turn to Palestine, where elections have just taken place, we want a secure Israel and a secure Palestinian state.
The European Union’s role must not – contrary to what we are told by not a few high-ranking representatives from the Middle East – be merely a matter of providing financial support, but should involve us, as an honest broker, making our contribution to bringing peace to the Middle East.
Turning to trans-Atlantic relations, I wish you, and of course the President of the Commission, great success with President Bush’s visit, which will usher in a new era of good relations with the United States of America.
We cannot have two groups of states in the European Union, each with its own way of maintaining relations with the USA.
We Europeans must unite in taking up a position founded upon partnership with our American friends, and so, as you, Mr President of the Council, have said, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, bring determination and passion to supporting you, and wish you great success in your presidency.
4. Report on the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances (
– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, where this issue of an appeal to the European Court of Justice is concerned, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is being entirely pragmatic in its approach.
What concerns us is that failure to come to the sort of agreement that the Commissioner has described will lead to a great deal of inconvenience for EU citizens travelling to the USA.
If the Americans do not get by this route the information they require, they will obtain it by other means, whether this involves questioning at the border, mandatory visas or interviews in Consulates-General.
Secondly, if we do not get this agreement, our citizens will be in no better a legal position as regards data protection; indeed, they will be in a worse one, because we will have no influence whatever on what the Americans do with the data they obtain.
With this in mind, we are grateful to the Commission for its efforts, and have, as a group, expressed our opposition to an appeal to the Court of Justice not only in the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also in the resolution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
in writing. - In favour.
The Council Decision referral for the European Parliament for consent procedure constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Protocol between the European Union and the Principality of Andorra extending to customs security measures the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Economic Community and the Principality of Andorra concluded on 28 June 1990.
The Agreement was the basis for the customs union between both parties.
The present arrangement concerning customs security measures will be added to the 1990 Agreement under the form of a new Title IIA and, unlike the customs union, will apply to agricultural products (Article 12b(2) of the Protocol).

Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-170/04
Under the Swedish Law on alcohol, retail sales of alcoholic beverages in Sweden are carried out under a monopoly held by Systembolaget.
Only Systembolaget and wholesalers authorised by the State may import alcoholic beverages.
Private individuals are prohibited from importing alcoholic beverages.
That prohibition means that a person wishing to import alcohol from other Member States must do so exclusively through Systembolaget.
Systembolaget is required to obtain any alcoholic beverage on request at the consumer’s expense, provided that it sees no objection to doing so.
Klas Rosengren and several other Swedish nationals ordered, by correspondence, cases of bottles of Spanish wine.
The wine was imported into Sweden, without being declared to customs, by a private transporter.
The wine was then confiscated by the customs authorities at Göteborg.
Criminal proceedings were brought against Mr Rosengren and other individuals for unlawful importation of alcoholic beverages.
The Högsta domstolen (Swedish Supreme Court), dealing with the case at final instance, asked the Court of Justice of the European Communities whether the provisions of the Swedish legislation are compatible with Community law, in particular with the principle of free movement of goods guaranteed by the Treaty.
As a preliminary point, the Court finds that the rules at issue must be assessed in the light of the Community provisions relating to free movement of goods and not in the light of the specific provisions relating to State monopolies, since the latter apply only to rules relating to the existence or operation of monopolies.
Does the Swedish legislation amount to a restriction on the free movement of goods?
Furthermore, the Court notes that consumers, when making use of the services of Systembolaget to secure the importation of alcoholic beverages, find that they face a variety of inconveniences with which they would not be faced if they imported the beverages themselves.
Above all, independently of administrative or logistical questions, it appears that for all importations, the price demanded of the purchaser includes, in addition to the cost of the beverages invoiced by the supplier, the reimbursement of administrative and transport costs paid by Systembolaget and a margin of 17% which, in principle, the purchaser would not have to pay if he directly imported those goods himself.
Can that restriction be justified?
The Court recognises that measures which amount to quantitative restrictions on imports can be justified on grounds of protection of the health and life of humans.
Rules which seek to prevent the harmful effects of alcohol and to combat alcohol abuse may therefore be justified in that regard.
Nevertheless, a restriction can be justified only to the extent that it is necessary and proportionate for the effective protection of the health and life of humans.
Thus, the prohibition of importation must be considered unsuitable for attaining the objective of protecting the health and life of persons.
Furthermore, it is not established that age checks could not be carried out using methods which are at least equally effective and less restrictive.
For example, the Commission submitted, without being contradicted, that a declaration system by which the recipient certifies, on a form accompanying the goods, that he is over 20 years of age would achieve the same objective.
In those circumstances, the Court rules that the prohibition of importation of alcoholic beverages cannot be justified on grounds of protection of the life and health of humans.

Eurobarometer: Half of all Europeans are satisfied with their railways, but more needs to be done to improve the service offer
According to a Eurobarometer survey published today, 58% of Europeans are satisfied with rail services in their country.
However, comparatively few Europeans take the train.
In some countries, the number of users who consider it overly complicated to buy tickets is worryingly high.
Commission Vice-President Siim Kallas, in charge of transport, said: "
Only a quarter of travellers in the EU take train on a regular basis.
This is not enough.
We need to make rail travel more attractive, and this study has shown us very clearly where action is needed.
For example, it is unacceptable that it is so complicated in some countries to buy train tickets.
Opting for a train needs to be as quick and easy as getting the car out of the garage."
In January 2012, the Commission tabled the 4th railway package with far-reaching proposals to open domestic passenger rail services to competition.
Tickets and information
The highest rates of satisfaction are found in the UK (70%), Finland and Ireland (68% and 62%).
Highest rates of dissatisfaction are found in France (47%) and Germany (42%).
The 4th railway package contains proposals that will enable common information and integrated ticketing systems.
Reliability
Satisfaction with punctuality and reliability is greatest in Ireland, Latvia, Austria and the UK (above 73%).
Dissatisfaction is highest in Italy (44%), Germany (42%), Poland (40%) and France (39%).
Overall, 59% of Europeans are satisfied with frequency.
Proposals, in the 4th railway package to reinforce infrastructure managers would strengthen the management of the railway network and improve reliability.
Accessibility
Satisfaction is highest in the UK (61%), Ireland (56%) and France (52%).
Below-average satisfaction rates are found in Germany, Sweden, Italy and Eastern Europe.
Questions of accessibility are essential in improving the modal share of rail, in particular in the context of the ageing of the European population.
Complaint handling
In 4 Member States (France, Latvia, Finland and Spain), satisfaction has even improved by more than 20 percentage points.
Current use of trains in the EU
Only 35% of Europeans use intercity trains several times a year or more, although 83% live within 30 minutes of a train station.
32% of Europeans never take intercity trains.
53% of Europeans do not use suburban trains at all, although 31% live within 10 minutes of a train station.
Only 14% use suburban trains several times a week.
Cars are still the dominant means of transport in Europe, but the pattern is changing: The average European travelled almost 9500km by car in 2010 – that is 100km less than in 2004.

Is Trump Killing the Dollar?
SANTA BARBARA – For nearly a century, the US dollar has been viewed as the financial world’s ultimate safe haven.
No other currency has promised the same degree of security and liquidity for accumulated wealth.
In past times of trouble, skittish investors and prudent central banks have all piled into dollar-denominated assets, not least US Treasury bonds.
This may no longer be the case.
US President Donald Trump’s chaotic administration has severely undermined confidence in the greenback.
Since being inaugurated before a phantom crowd of millions, Trump has picked fights with one government after another, including allies like Australia and Germany.
More recently, he has taken the world to the brink of nuclear war by locking horns with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
The dollar is about to face a serious test.
Will global investors continue to put their money in a country whose leader loudly provokes the Hermit Kingdom with threats of “fire and fury,” or will they find financial refuge elsewhere?
Not since World War II has the safety of the dollar been in such doubt.
In the post-war period, America’s extraordinarily large and well-developed financial markets promised unparalleled liquidity.
And because the US was the dominant military power, it could ensure geopolitical security, too.
No country was in a better position to supply safe and flexible investment-grade assets on the scale the global financial system required.
As New York investment strategist Kathy A. Jones told the New York Times in May 2012, “When people are worried, all roads lead to Treasuries.”
The bursting of the US real-estate bubble in 2007 is a case in point.
Everyone knew that the financial crisis and ensuing recession had started in the US, and that the country was to blame for a near-collapse of the global economy.
And yet, even at the height of the crisis, a tidal wave of capital flowed into US markets, enabling the US Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury to implement their response.
In the last three months of 2008 alone, net US-asset purchases topped $500 billion dollars – three times more than what was purchased in the preceding nine months.
Far from depreciating, the dollar strengthened.
The Treasury-bond market stood out as one of the few financial sectors that was still operating smoothly.
Even after the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded Treasury securities in response to a brief US government shutdown in mid-2011, outside investors continued to acquire dollars.
Much of the spike in demand for dollars ten years ago could be attributed to sheer fear: no one knew how bad things might get.
The same could be said of the US and North Korea’s escalating confrontation today.
But will history repeat itself, and send investors flocking toward the dollar?
The short answer is: don’t count on it.
Markets have been signaling their distrust of Trump for months now.
At this point, fear of a new crisis could precipitate capital flight away from the dollar, at which point the US would have to deal with a dollar crisis in addition to a potential military conflict.
Risk of a dollar crisis seemed minimal in the weeks immediately following Trump’s surprising electoral victory last November.
In fact, by the end of last year, capital inflows had pushed the dollar up to levels not seen in more than a decade, owing to expectations of large-scale deregulation, tax cuts, and fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and increased outlays for America’s supposedly “depleted” military.
Economic growth, investors believed, was bound to improve.
But with the Trump administration now engulfed by scandals, the post-election “Trump bump” has faded, along with faith in the dollar.
In the administration’s first 200 days, the dollar has lost almost 10% of its value.
While Trump has been tweeting nonsense, investors have been looking for alternative safe havens in other markets, from Switzerland to Japan.
This trend began before the US’s latest contretemps with North Korea, but it was only a trickle then.
Now, that trickle is threatening to turn into a flood that will leave the dollar permanently damaged.
Of course, the Trump administration might actually want a weaker dollar, and to let others assume the role of global safe haven.
But such an abdication would be historically – and dangerously – shortsighted.
The dollar’s popularity as a store of value confers an “exorbitant privilege” to the US.
When investors and central banks place their wealth in Treasury bonds and other US assets, the US government can go on spending whatever it needs to sustain its many security commitments around the world, and to finance its trade and budget deficits.
With his transactional approach to politics, Trump seems to focus more on the costs of having a global reserve currency than on the advantages.
But he cannot hope to “Make America Great Again” if he has to worry about capital flight, and he will not be able to enact his domestic agenda if he has to accommodate negative market sentiments abroad.
There will be nothing “great” about an America that has sacrificed its dominant position in the global financial system.
If Trump tests the dollar too much, he will probably come to regret it.

The Revenge of the Special Relationship
NEW YORK – Seventy-five years ago, the prestige of the United States and the United Kingdom could not have been higher.
They had defeated imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, and they did so in the name of freedom and democracy.
True, their ally, Stalin’s Soviet Union, had different ideas about these fine ideals, and did most of the fighting against Hitler’s Wehrmacht.
Still, the English-speaking victors shaped the post-war order in large parts of the world.
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year. From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
The basic principles of this order had been laid down in the Atlantic Charter, drawn up in 1941 by Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt on a battleship off the coast of Newfoundland.
What they had in mind, after the eventual defeat of the Axis powers, was a world of international cooperation, multilateral institutions, and the right of peoples to be independent and free.
Although Churchill resisted extending this right to Britain’s colonial subjects, Roosevelt believed that the Anglo-American relationship was too important to quarrel about it too much.
For many decades, despite a number of reckless wars, eruptions of Cold War hysteria, and opportunistic support for some very undemocratic allies, the UK and the US maintained their image as models of liberal democracy and internationalism.
In the age of Donald Trump and Brexit, this image has been shattered.
Of all the older democracies, it is in Britain and the US that right-wing populists have taken over conservative parties and rule their respective countries.
The same has happened in Hungary and Poland, but they were never models of liberalism, and also in India, but its democracy is not as old.
Trump’s Republicans – with their slogan of “America First,” borrowed from the isolationists of the 1930s, who were often more sympathetic to Hitler than to Roosevelt – stand for everything FDR opposed.
And Britain has turned its back on Europe in a way that Churchill – an internationalist and one of the first advocates of European unity (though he was vague about Britain’s role in a united Europe) – never would have condoned.
How could this have happened?
Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more – All for less than $9 a month.
There are of course many reasons, which are not unique to the US or the UK: increasing economic inequality, sclerotic institutions, complacent elites, animus against immigrants, and so on.
But I would argue that the current troubles in both countries are linked to their greatest triumph in 1945.
Having emerged from isolationism and defeated the Axis powers, the US might have grown a little high on its military power.
The temptation to regard Churchill (always more popular in the US than Britain was) as a model of leadership has led many American presidents astray.
His is the bulldog face of Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism and heroic stands for freedom that play to US leaders’ self-regard.
George W. Bush was not the first presidential Churchill-worshipper who decided to embark on a misconceived war, in his case in Iraq against Saddam Hussein, who was brutal, but not remotely as threatening as Hitler.
Trump’s revival of “America First” isolationism, his loathing for international institutions and US allies in the democratic world, are at least partly the result of Bush’s disastrous war.
Trump appealed to the kind of people – white, rural, often poorly educated, and deeply resentful of coastal elites – who were sent off to die in America’s overseas adventures.
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair was as much of a Churchill-worshipper as Bush.
He, too, had an almost messianic view of the Anglo-American alliance on a mission to rid the world of contemporary “Hitlers.”
At the time of the Iraq War, he argued that only one nation had stood by Britain in its hour of gravest peril in 1940.
That is why now Britain had to join America in the invasion of Iraq.
Leaving aside the historical error (the US had not yet entered the war against Germany), Blair’s nostalgia served a foolish purpose.
But, from Suez in 1956 to Vietnam in the 1960s and Iraq in 2003, nostalgia was not the only reason presidents and prime ministers since 1945 have gone to war.
The other specter haunting occupants of the White House and 10 Downing Street has been that of Neville Chamberlain and his “appeasement” of Hitler in 1938.
Realizing that his country was not ready or willing to go to war, Chamberlain let Hitler invade Czechoslovakia (“a quarrel in a faraway country”).
Churchill denounced this policy as “a total and unmitigated defeat.”
The fear of being viewed as another Chamberlain has been just as strong among postwar leaders as the hope of repeating Churchill’s glory.
That glory brought Britain close to bankruptcy, but the lingering memory of its finest hour was even more destructive to the country’s fortunes.
Britain stayed aloof from every European effort to establish common institutions, not just because Clement Attlee’s socialist government in the 1940s believed that Europe would destroy Britain’s welfare state, but also because the British could not conceive of their country being on a par with other European powers.
Britain had won the war; the others had either been Nazis or were overrun by Nazis.
Even after leaders such as Harold Macmillan realized that the UK could not afford to stay out of the European Economic Community, the lure of standing shoulder to shoulder with the US, especially in faraway wars, was stronger than the desire to play a leading role in Europe.
When Britain was still very much primus inter pares in the 1950s, other Europeans would have been happy to let it take the lead and shape the continent’s future.
The US, much less sentimental about the “special relationship” than Britain, urged the British to do so.
US Secretary of State Dean Acheson described the refusal to seize the opportunity as Britain’s “greatest mistake of the post-war period.”
So here we are, with an isolationist America and Britain increasingly cut off from Europe.
Their moment of greatest glory turned out to contain the seeds of future disaster.
Mr President, this draft directive, a sensible and necessary one, was welcomed as such by the business community as a whole.
We should establish proportionate and loophole-free rules to apply fairly and uniformly across the whole of European business and industry.
We also have an acceptable compromise report before us.
Our aim has been to prevent accidents and the consequent damage to the environment and human health that can result from the handling and disposal of waste materials from the mineral oil-extracting industries, and we have sought to do this by laying down minimum standards to improve the management of this sort of waste.
Waste from the extractive industries amounts to some 400 million tonnes per annum, equivalent to 29% of the waste produced by the Community as a whole.
Managing it does of course involve risks; we are all familiar with the accidents in such places as Baia Mare and Aberfan, among others.
The fact is that ecologically-responsible rules for waste management not only reduce the quantity of waste, but also give businesses an incentive to invest in research into environmental issues associated with the extractive industries and thereby acquire from the world market know-how that they can analyse.
There are many examples of this: let me give you one from Austria, where one firm has managed to avoid depositing some 100 000 tonnes of minerals used in construction in landfill sites.
Despite that, there are weak points, one example being the lack of clarity as to the directive’s scope.
I find it regrettable that a majority could not be found to support the amendment I tabled on this subject.
I would also like to point out the need for provisions to be enacted to deal with non-hazardous or inert waste, and that these must be proportionate.
I therefore believe that Amendments 11, 13 and 47 should be rejected and that we should come up with alternative proposals for provisions relating to non-hazardous and inert waste, with separate consideration for these concepts.
The use of landfill sites for non-hazardous or inert waste should also be allowed for a limited period of time.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this House did a remarkable job of work in approving Mr Fava's report.
Similarly, I think the General Assembly of the Council of Europe made a significant contribution to ascertaining a truth that has now been proven: there have been thousands of flights, there have been dozens of kidnappings, and there has been direct involvement of European governments and EU intelligence services.
We have witness statements and we also have the minutes of the special European Parliament committee, testifying to the fact that European governments sat down with the US administration and discussed extraordinary rendition.
This is a proven fact and public knowledge, which I believe deserves to be respected even by those colleagues who voted against this report.
There is only one black hole in this affair: the silence of the Council.
It is rather embarrassing here, given that everyone else has spoken out.
However, there is one anomaly: while the Council remains silent the governments are acting.
It is not true that the governments are turning a blind eye; they are doing whatever they can to prevent clarification of the truth.
For instance, the Italian Government is currently avoiding seeking the extradition of the CIA agents involved in the judicial measures and has even invoked official secrecy to slow down the judicial activity on the case of Abu Omar.
Thus the governments are indeed acting while the Council maintains its silence.
In my opinion this is wrong!
The excellent work done by this House deserves respect, and surely a sign of respect should come first and foremost from the Council.
(FI) Mr President, I agree with Mr Marinescu that the forthcoming Council should find a solution to two issues.
One is completing the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the other is new cures for the economic and financial crisis.
We are presently living through the deepest crisis in Europe's economic history.
This crisis will mean a thorough shake-up of people's opportunities, income, pensions and jobs, and we must be aware of that.
The European Union began its recovery very well.
We should thank the Commission for that.
The Commission and the European Central Bank even acted so quickly that the United States of America followed Europe's example.
Then things rather oddly began to slow down and people started to say that the crisis was over.
The crisis, however, in fact lies ahead, because a four-bladed guillotine hangs over the European Union, in the shape of growing unemployment, indebted national economies, an ageing population, and the huge structural change which will take place in the forestry industry, the car industry, and so on.
Actually, the only good thing about this economic crisis is that policy is required to resolve the problems.
As for the new financial architecture, the Commission is being quite unambitious about this.
Hopefully, the financial crisis work group that Parliament has set up will be a new source of guidance.
The objective must be the regulation of the financial markets.
Over-regulation, however, must not be allowed to prevent growth and employment.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Záborská, for the excellent work she has done.
I would also like to congratulate the President on her election.
It is excellent that the European Parliament has made it compulsory for the committees to implement gender mainstreaming.
This is a process that is bound to take a long time, and it is important that the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is heading the project.
I know that there are also those in Parliament that are doubtful about all this, and I feel that in most cases it is those very people who need to be educated in the matter of equality.
When I was made responsible for this issue in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I asked the Committee on Women's Rights to specify those tasks that had to be accomplished in gender mainstreaming, and the committee produced the questionnaire in a form that was instructive and very welcome.
I drafted a preliminary proposal for the Committee on the Environment based on this questionnaire.
There are still no decisions on it, but I will be proposing in my committee, for example, that every year the Committee on Women's Rights should produce statistics on the gender distribution among coordinators and rapporteurs and in the secretariat.
I will also propose that a pilot project should be set up to establish mainstreaming in particular and to identify areas where especially close cooperation should be engaged in with the Committee on Women's Rights.
In my view, the Committee on Women's Rights could produce for the plenary sessions more concrete draft resolutions than these on what the committees should be doing.
I believe that this issue should be taken forward in the most effective way possible, so that plenary can both make binding decisions and recommendations on what should be done on the committee.
Finally, I would like to say that the political groups should also be paying heed to gender equality.
It is the political groups that will have the main role in deciding how equality is to be implemented when they elect their chairs and fill the posts of chair and deputy chair of committees in negotiations between groups.
Ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur Mr Brok has done thorough work in showing the countries of the western Balkans the path to the European Union.
It is my duty as leader of the Moldova delegation, however, to remind us all of the fact that there are two countries even closer to the heart of Europe which need the promise of European Union membership just as much as the Balkan countries and Turkey.
The European Parliament has clearly expressed its support for the aspirations of Ukraine and Moldova to become candidates for membership of the European Union.
Moldova has been making a huge effort for two years.
Ukraine has also recently shown that it wishes to become a European country.
I sensed that very clearly when I visited Ukraine last week.
I am disappointed, however, with the excessive emphasis placed on the fourth Copenhagen criterion in the report.
At the same time, I agree with Elmar Brok that the European Commission should define the nature of accession capacity as soon as possible.
This should not be a vague excuse for rejecting countries wishing to accede to the European Union.
Since the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, our union has been reformed.
This is the success story of those countries that fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria.
Potential candidate countries must in future also be evaluated on the basis of transparent criteria.
Expansion must continue, because Europe needs stability in the same way it needs air.
– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, road tolls are never popular, especially if one is paying them oneself, but they are a fact of life in today’s Europe all the same.
They are necessary.
It is just a question of how we can minimise the bother they cause and the costs that result.
Various systems have now been introduced at local and national level, but they are not compatible.
Obviously, to avoid problems, they have to be harmonised.
The excellent aim of this Commission proposal is that each and everyone should have just one contract and every vehicle just one box, for the internal market to function properly.
This is only reasonable.
I agree with Mrs Sommer that the interoperability of road tolls is the objective, rather than the means of achieving it.
I would disagree somewhat with the Commission: in my opinion, we need to be more flexible as far as local authorities are concerned, because then good, viable schemes already in operation would not have to be scrapped just because satellite systems are being adopted too rapidly.
The fact that the systems should be mutually functional is the goal, not that they should work using microwaves or any other waves.
That is why it is sufficient that general requirements should be determined to achieve the basic object of the directive, which is the interoperability of the systems.
That is crucial.
A dynamic Europe needs road transport.
An ever more affluent Europe needs mobility.
Good though it might be that we standardise these systems, we must also make sure that we keep costs at a reasonable level and do not voluntarily place ourselves in a straitjacket.
Mr President, I wish to draw attention to an innovation in European marine conservation.
On Saturday, Scotland became the first country in Europe to implement a voluntary scheme of real-time closures of fishing grounds, with the aim of safeguarding cod stocks.
That scheme, which was developed as a joint initiative between the new Scottish Government and the fishing industry, will hopefully provide a template for future marine conservation projects.
I understand that the Scottish Government has engaged with its counterparts in Denmark and Norway with a view to learning from this particular project.
The common fisheries policy has been nothing but a disaster for Scotland to date, and I firmly believe that the future of fisheries management lies not in central control from Brussels but in direct cooperation between fishing nations.
The Scottish Government and the industry are to be commended for taking such an innovative approach on this matter.
I hope, in the mean time, that when it comes to the December Council their voluntary efforts will be taken into account, recognised and rewarded.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, today is Armistice Day, when we commemorate hostilities coming to an end in the First World War.
Therefore, in order to commemorate the armistice that brought an end to the First World War, we are going to observe a minute's silence in memory of the millions of Europeans who lost their lives in that struggle.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
– Mr President, Sri Lanka is in a situation of cohabitation, with a President and a Prime Minister belonging to two rival political formations.
For twenty years now, each political formation in power has sought to make peace with the Tamil Tigers and on each occasion the opposition has ruined the peace process.
Thus, when the current Prime Minister was in opposition, he ruined the President’s plan to give greater autonomy to the Tamils in the north-east of the country, where they are in the majority.
Since he has been Prime Minister, he has made significant progress in the negotiations with the LTTE, with the assistance of the Norwegian mediators, finally achieving a ceasefire that lasted several months and changed the people’s lives while allowing a limited economic upturn.
For the first time since the movement came into being, the Tamil freedom fighters had just published concrete proposals for power-sharing in a region that, although run by the Tamils themselves, would continue to form part of Sri Lanka.
These proposals were negotiable, but then the President took upon herself the heavy responsibility of halting this peace process, making the most of the Prime Minister’s trip to the United States and her constitutional prerogatives.
She thus dissolved the parliament and recalled the Ministers for Defence, the Interior and Information in order to sack them.
That was the situation up until a few days ago.
Today, the parliament has resumed its activities and the President is negotiating with her Prime Minister, which is why I feel that we must seize this opportunity.
A conciliation commission has even been set up between the two arms of the executive.
Our group sincerely believes that the European Parliament must send a very clear sign to the political leaders in Sri Lanka to encourage them to find a solution to the political crisis, but also, and above all, a constitutional solution that will allow for a lasting agreement with the Tamils.
We also express our support for the Norwegian mediation team in its efforts to get the peace process back on track.
in writing. - (PT) The common fisheries policy, which was last revised in 2002, is not yet sufficient to weather the vicissitudes of this sensitive sector.
For this reason, it is necessary to analyse the new factors that are affecting the sector and find new solutions to make it completely viable, particularly in economic, social and environmental terms.
I therefore recommend that new measures be taken to allow the fishing sector to escape from its current perilous situation.
The fisheries industry is very important in the EU.
It is therefore vital that the new CFP takes account of the rational and responsible management of resources, and that it concerns itself with protecting marine resources and maintaining the way of life of those who have always earned their living from fishing.
The new CFP needs to be capable of resolving productivity problems within the sector, stabilising markets and ensuring a good standard of living for families who are dependent on this sector.
However, this sector should be analysed as a whole, not in sections, so that we can integrate all its problems and vicissitudes in order to resolve them to the satisfaction of all those involved, and overcome the main problems affecting it: overfishing, overcapacity, overinvestment and wastage.
ECHO is working in partnership with Médecins Sans Frontières - Belgium (MSF) on a programme to last three months, with funding of 200,000 ECU to help people survive the alert.
The plan is to provide safe drinking water, as well as medicines and medical supplies, including rehydration salts and antibiotics.
MSF will also carry out an epidemiological survey to trace the course of the epidemic. * * *
(FR) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in these dramatic hours when Libya's future is at stake, humanitarian aid is important but it is not enough.
The European Union must adopt a clear position with regard to a no-fly zone so as to put a stop to the fierce repression of the people.
We understand the hesitation and the risks, but this issue goes beyond Libya.
It affects the political future of that entire region and the political future of Europe.
The European Union must also urgently recognise the National Council as the legitimate authority of Libya.
We have an opportunity to send a strong message to all the peoples fighting for their freedom: 'Europe is behind you, because your struggle is our struggle, too'.
The neighbourhood policy must also be reoriented towards assisting the democratic transition, supporting the economy, and strengthening relations with the other countries and organisations in the region.
Lastly, we must urgently help these countries to manage their migratory flows.
The scenes of people fleeing are proof that this is just as much a South-South issue as it is a North-South one.
Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the time has come to make a choice: either Europe sends a clear message of support and mobilisation to help these peoples, or it builds a wall so as to turn itself into an illusory, selfish fortress.
– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the matters described by Mr Schulz and to endorse his request for the allegations to be examined immediately and the public and ourselves to be informed.
Between 50 and 60 German MEPs have been maliciously accused of having wrongly drawn their daily allowance, allegations that I emphatically reject!
The daily allowance is not remuneration for participation in the sessions.
In addition to participating in the sessions, we all have innumerable other tasks to perform, which are not entered in any session schedule, and in order to be present for such works in Brussels or in Strasbourg daily allowances are needed to meet expenses.
Accordingly, we cannot accept being defamed in this way.
I once again emphatically reject the allegations.
A Member of this House is exploiting his parliamentary rights in order to spy on colleagues in the most unworthy and disgusting way.
For this reason also, Mr President, I demand that these events be investigated immediately and that – as I have said – the public and we ourselves should be informed.

Securing Nuclear Material
VIENNA – World leaders have devoted increasing attention in recent years to the risk of terrorists obtaining nuclear or other radioactive material.
That’s the good news.
But all of us need to act with greater urgency in translating good intentions into concrete action.
The risk of nuclear or other radioactive material falling into the wrong hands is all too real.
There have been embarrassing security lapses at nuclear facilities, and sensitive material is often inadequately secured.
Indeed, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) records numerous cases of theft and other unauthorized activities involving nuclear and radioactive material every year.
Most of these incidents are fairly minor, but some are more serious.
Some material goes missing and is never found.
An incident in Moldova two years ago involving highly enriched uranium – which can be used in a nuclear weapon – illustrates both the scale of the threat and the possibility of effective counter-measures if countries take the problem seriously.
Police seized a quantity of the substance from an individual who was attempting to sell it.
The smugglers had tried to evade detection by building a shielded container – a worrisome level of sophistication on their part.
Fortunately, the Moldovan authorities had been working hard to improve their detection capabilities.
They had also shared information with their counterparts in other countries.
The uranium was seized in a sting operation.
Arrests were made and several people received prison sentences.
Most cases of attempted trafficking do not involve nuclear material; rather, they involve radioactive substances of the type held in hospitals, factories, and other locations all over the world.
These locations are generally not as well protected as nuclear facilities.
Even a relatively small amount of material such as cobalt-60 – used in radiotherapy – could cause serious harm if combined with conventional explosives in a so-called dirty bomb (or otherwise deliberately used to expose the public to dangerous radiation).
Foreign and energy ministers will have an opportunity to strengthen the global nuclear security framework when they meet at the International Conference on Nuclear Security: Enhancing Global Efforts in Vienna on July 1-5.
This will be the first such event that is open to all countries.
At the top of the agenda should be ratification of improvements to a crucial nuclear security instrument – theConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.
The proposed amendment would oblige countries to protect nuclear material when it is being used or stored, not just when it is being transported internationally, as is the case now.
It would also require countries to protect nuclear facilities against acts of sabotage, which could have consequences similar to those of nuclear accidents.
The proposed amendment was agreed in 2005, but it still has not entered into force, because not enough countries have ratified it.
That needs to change if major vulnerabilities are to be addressed successfully.
Nuclear security is a matter of global concern, and global action is required.
Efforts by just a handful of major players will not be sufficient to keep the world safe.
We cannot afford to have weak links in our chain of defense.
All countries must play their part.
Even countries that do not possess nuclear or other radioactive material need to act.
There is evidence that criminal and terrorist gangs have attempted to traffic material through countries perceived to have lax security.
It is imperative that they do not succeed.
One simple measure would make a big difference: All countries should allow peer reviews of their nuclear-security arrangements by international experts.
Peer reviews have been shown to work – for example, in improving safety at nuclear power plants.
Everyone benefits.
Bringing experts in nuclear security together to share their experience is a no-brainer.
More countries need to do it.
Following Moldova’s example, all countries should also ensure that law-enforcement officers are properly trained to respond to the menace of nuclear terrorism.
Countries must invest in equipment and infrastructure and share information across borders.
The fact that there has been no major nuclear terrorist attack should not lull us into a fall sense of security.
The threat remains.
We must seize the opportunity to ensure that our worst nightmare never becomes our waking reality.
Madam President, today’s debate has raised many questions, in particular with regard to the impact the reform will have on the new Member States.
The question we should be asking is whether something extraordinary has happened to the world’s sugar trade or sugar production in the two years since the EU underwent its last enlargement to justify such a sudden change in sugar policy, and the answer to this question is ‘no’.
I mention this because the effects of this reform will hit the new Member States hardest.
It is not uncommon for farmers in these countries to have invested all their savings in their farms, even though they have been treated unfairly.
I would remind the House that farmers in the old EU Member States receive three times more in land subsidies than those in the new Member States.
This reform has no doubt been several years in the making, which means that the public in the new Member States was intentionally misled, or even deceived, at the time of accession.
Implementation of this reform will be further proof that the idea of European solidarity and genuine assistance for the new Member States is an illusion.
Genuine assistance means giving the new Member States a real chance to develop their economies, rather than granting them subsidies on a short-term basis.
One or even several countries can be outvoted, but the Polish public is opposed to a reform of this kind, and objects to being constantly cheated.
I too would be happy to do without an EU that is run along these lines.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for staying here with us today.
Unlike many MEPs, I have been to Palestine more than once.
In line with what everyone here wished, Israel has left Gaza, and handed it over to a free, democratically elected government.
Gaza is therefore not some military outpost, it is a country devastated by the extremism, fundamentalism, terrorism, corruption and cynicism of the Palestinian warlords themselves.
Ladies and gentlemen, are we naïve enough to think that throwing more hundreds of millions of euros without clear guidelines will stop Jund Al-Islam or Mohamed Dahlan from further acts of violence?
Do we honestly believe that legalising warlords and terrorists like Khaled Mashal or Dahlan will bring peace to the region?
Fortunately, the Council and the Commission have taken a firm, clear stance, and I wish to thank them for that.
I am grateful that on this tricky matter, they have adopted the right position.
We should reject violence and pay tribute to the victims of Gaza and the West Bank.
We must state clearly our opposition to Hamas using its power in the Palestinian Government to attack Israel to further its appallingly extremist interests.
I wish to warn against working with Hamas, including Members of the government, as this is clearly proscribed, or with new Al-Qaeda organisations such as Fatah Al-Islam and Jund Al-Islam.
We call on the Palestinian Government not only to recognise the exchange of letters between Rabin and Arafat but also to stop lying about fulfilling the key condition of recognising Israel.
We call on the Palestinian Government and on all Arab politicians, in particular the Saudis and Egyptians, to acknowledge all of their political and human responsibilities and to take part immediately in peace negotiations involving full recognition of the State of Israel within duly recognised international borders.
We call on Fatah to begin negotiations with Hamas without delay on the sharing of power within the President's Office.
It is only by adopting the right position and having a clearly-stated standpoint that we will be able genuinely to provide humanitarian aid and, most importantly, to support the emergence of a viable, democratic Palestinian state.
A Prisoner’s Reflections on Nelson Mandela
KHARKIV – Incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability.
But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite.
As a prisoner, I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself, my political beliefs, and my country.
So I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men, old and young, who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future.
In prison, your hopes and dreams become your reality.
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed.
The South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades, but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality, courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence.
Around the world, most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness.
Even here, behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long, I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile, merry eyes, and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache.
And I can admire his unyielding – and, yes, sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation, which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable.
How wrong they were, and how miraculous was Mandela’s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa.
But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination. “My” Mandela is the prisoner, the Mandela of Robben Island, who endured 27 years behind bars (18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic) and yet emerged with his spirit intact, brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa, a country liberated even for apartheid’s architects and beneficiaries.
No purges marked the end of white rule.
There were no witch-hunts, nor was there summary justice.
All that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed.
Through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country’s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess.
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom, because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison.
Indeed, he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture.
Imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well. “Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties, either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts,” he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago.
“This line shifts….And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained.
And even in the best of all hearts, there remains...an un-uprooted small corner of evil.”
The ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow.
Forced to reckon with your own vulnerability, isolation, and losses (and seemingly lost cause), you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers.
Mandela epitomized this rare gift.
How else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa’s first democratically elected president?
Of course, behind Mandela’s generous spirit was a character of steel.
He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause.
And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family.
And yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people.
As usual, Mandela’s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this: “As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.” And just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall, I know in my solitude that Ukraine’s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain.
in writing. - (NL) I am pleased that the European Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of a mandatory 20% energy savings target in 2020.
Forecasts indicate that, with the current policy, Europe will only achieve an 11% energy saving.
Meanwhile, households waste EUR 1 000 of energy a year and we annually export no less than EUR 350 billion of our European welfare to oil-rich nations.
Better insulation for houses, more efficient energy transport and more efficient appliances ensure a lower energy bill for consumers and businesses.
There are often barriers to these effective measures being taken, such as high investment costs or uncertainty about the benefits.
If the European ministers support this proposal, governments will have to step up their support for energy conservation measures.
These measures will ultimately bring in money, because the energy bill will be lower.
Energy conservation is the cheapest way for us to reach our climate target and will lead to 560 million tonnes less CO2 emissions.
Energy conservation therefore makes it even easier for us to raise our climate target a little.
Unfortunately, we are still hopelessly behind; according to a recent report, we need to triple the European target if we are to achieve a 20% energy saving.
It is therefore important that this target be imposed as binding on all EU Member States.
Brussels, 6 February 2007
Commission study points the way forward for better regulation of new media and the digital economy
Where such self- and co-regulatory models are credible and efficient, the European Commission will encourage their use, in particular for the online environment.
This is the spirit included also in the provisions of the European Commission's proposal for modernising the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which I expect to be agreed between European Parliament and Council in the months to come."
Particularly in the digital economy, driven by rapid technological change and enhanced user control, traditional regulations are finding it difficult to keep up with the speed of technological, economical and social changes, and the problem of decentralised information.
The European Commission therefore views self- and co-regulation as a way to achieve better regulation, an important goal of the Barroso Commission (see IP/05/96).
Self regulation, where industry regulates itself, and co-regulation, the combination of state and non-state regulation, will help cope with the increasing risk of failure of traditional approaches, and will hand back responsibility to society and interested parties where appropriate.
The study on co-regulation measures in the media sector was undertaken for the Commission by the Hans-Bredow Institut for media research, at the University of Hamburg, in cooperation with the Institute for European Media Law in Saarbrücken, and presented today in Brussels.
It concluded that, in general, industry needs sufficient incentives to support such a regime.
Having a state run regulator in the background often gives self-regulatory bodies the power they need to work effectively.
In addition, sufficient means to enforce regulations, such as adequate and proportional sanctions seem to be necessary for a co-regulatory system to be workable.
Transparency and openness were also found to be vital to build trust in the mechanisms, particularly where non-State organisations are responsible for regulating, or where interest groups are not involved.
Self- and co-regulation are therefore explicitly encouraged by the European Commission in the proposed modernisation of the "Television Without Frontiers" Directive, currently being debated in the European Parliament and Council.
Member States shall encourage co-regulatory regimes in the fields coordinated by this Directive.
These regimes shall be such that they are broadly accepted by the main stakeholders and provide for effective enforcement.”).
Further good examples of current self- and co-regulation in the EU include:
§ Today's signing by mobile operators of a European Framework agreement on safer use of mobile phones by children (see IP/07/139).
§ The Film Online Charter signed by the film and content industries in May 2006 (see IP/06/672)
§ The management of the .eu domain by the private not-for-profit agency EURid, entrusted with this task by the European Parliament and the Council (see IP/05/1510, IP/06/476 and MEMO/06/332).
§ The food industries efforts to fight obesity (IP/06/1530).
§ The role of the European Aviation Safety Agency in safeguarding Europe's skies (IP/05/1422).

(DE) Mr President, I address you, Baroness Ashton, as Vice-President of the Commission, but also as High Representative - as, in contrast to the foreign ministers, I assume that, as High Representative, you also have some degree of political responsibility to this House.
Today marks 100 days since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force.
There are two imminent and significant decisions to be made in terms of our direction of travel. One of them - as you, too, said at the beginning - is to expand foreign policy because the climate, energy and other matters are part of foreign policy, and the other is creating a dynamic and effective External Action Service.
Speaking of energy policy, Copenhagen showed that, if we are not united, if we are fragmented, if every Head of Government believes that he or she has to produce something specific, we will achieve less than we would otherwise have done.
Not that we would have achieved something amazing, given the position of China and of the United States, but the terrible soap opera that was Copenhagen really should not be allowed to happen again.
Therefore - and I agree with Mr Brok in this regard - we need to obtain a sturdy External Action Service.
I, like many of us, am not surprised, but am nonetheless appalled, to see how many of the foreign ministers are making problems for you out of petty jealousy.
We are saying this very plainly.
Many do give you their support, but many are making problems.
They simply cannot tolerate the fact that they no longer have the lead role to play and are instead foreign ministers again.
At the end of the day, being a foreign minister is not a bad job, and it does not need to mean that you should decide every detail of what goes on in the European Union.
For that reason, we also say clearly from here that we will use our parliamentary capabilities to the full not to prevent something, but to build something constructive.
An External Action Service is constructive - as it says in the Treaty of Lisbon - when it is clearly subordinate to you, Baroness Ashton, and also, of course, when it collaborates closely with the Commission.
Similarly, we will not tolerate any legal activity that has hitherto been conducted using the Community method and that is to continue in that way under the Treaty of Lisbon suddenly becoming intergovernmental.
That, you see, is exactly what many ministers and perhaps even many Heads of Government want, not only in order to undermine the Commission a little, but also to undermine Community law.
That is not acceptable. A clear line must be drawn.
How that will play out in relation to the External Action Service is something there will be discussions about over the coming weeks - as before.
I will thus also finish on something that has already been said.
It is not a question of timing, even if we do want a solution quickly, but one of content-based presentation.
It needs to be said once again, specifically to the Council of Foreign Ministers, that this Parliament will exercise its rights - no more, but also no less - in connection with the budget and the Staff Regulations because we have a goal, which is an effective and efficient External Action Service.
(Applause)
Many thanks, Commissioner.
Indeed, your speech was very interesting and on an issue that is also very important.
The item is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 February 2009.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Brussels, 22 September 1998
11285/98
The Summit reflects their mutual strategic interest in developing a new partnership through qualitative progress in political dialogue, economic relations and in cooperation between Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union.
The agenda for the Summit covers three basic sets of themes: i) political dialogue, ii) economic and trade issues and iii) cultural, educational and human affairs.
These will be dealt with on the basis of an exchange of experiences, consultation, the enhancement of existing cooperation and the identification of possible new fields for cooperation.
The Summit will seek to achieve ambitious joint objectives, such as:
Providing new impetus to the further development and diversification of trade, taking into account ongoing or future multilateral and bilateral negotiations for the liberalization of trade and reaffirming the commitment to existing frameworks, promoting conditions favourable to investment and trade diversification and, in particular, strengthening the multilateral trading system.
The Summit will also provide an opportunity for an exchange of views on issues of common interest concerning the international economic and financial situation with the aim of promoting stability as an essential prerequisite for global economic growth.
Europe's War of Big and Small
The debate on proposals for a new Constitution for the European Union, now entering its final stage in the so-called "European Convention," is turning into a power struggle between member states over rival visions of the future of the Union.
In the past, the main axis of debate was usually been between federalists, who want a stronger EU, and inter-governmentalists, who want to preserve the member states' national autonomy. This remains true today.
But the debate is now being distorted by a secondary struggle between the EU's large and small countries, with results that are sometimes paradoxical.
The immediate issue is management of the EU Council of Ministers.
At present, the Council meets under the Presidency of an individual member state for a period of six months, at the end of which the Presidency rotates to another member state.
France and Germany argue that this rotational system is dysfunctional, partly because of discontinuity, and have proposed that the Council should appoint a full-time permanent President for a period of five years.
Their proposal was categorically rejected in a joint submission by 16 existing or future member states, all of them small countries, who insisted that the principle of rotation must be retained, as a symbol of the equality of all member states.
The stakes on this issue have now been raised two notches higher. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the President of the Convention, has formally endorsed the Franco-German proposal.
The same day, the European Commission hit back with a strong criticism of the proposal, saying that it would create rival bureaucracies and a sense of confusion.
The deep reason for this particular argument is the EU's looming enlargement, which will take the membership from 15 to 25 countries in May 2004.
When the European enterprise started, there were three small and three large countries; but almost all the new members are small countries.
So after enlargement there will be six large and 19 small member states.
This re-balancing between the large and small member states is shifting some old assumptions in a number of paradoxical ways.
In the past, small member states used to gravitate towards federalist positions, because they calculated that they needed strong central institutions to contain the power of the large member states (especially France).
Today, by insisting on Presidential rotation and the equality of member states, whatever their size, the small countries are effectively adopting an inter-governmentalist position, because they fear that the real purpose of the Franco-German proposal is to ensure that the Council will remain under the leadership of a big member.
There is, in fact, little doubt that is what France and Germany (and Britain) intend.
So here is the second paradox: both large and small EU countries imagine that they can optimize their relative leverage by adopting inter-governmentalist positions.
They cannot both be right.
It is far too soon to draw hard and fast conclusions.
The "Convention," though influential, is just a debating group; the real negotiations between governments will come later this year.
We can have no idea in advance how a 25-member EU will really operate; practical realities will exert their influence on political chemistry.
It is conceivable that the swarm of small new member states may revert to the traditional and logical predisposition towards federalism.
But my personal hunch is that the Franco-German proposal is based on a fundamental error of judgment.
To understand why, consider that their proposal for a permanent Council President was paired with a proposal that the Commission President--currently nominated by the Council of Ministers--should in future be elected by the European Parliament, and subsequently be endorsed by a majority vote of the Council of Ministers.
If adopted, this innovation would confer much greater political legitimacy on the Commission President, as well as greater independence from the Council of Ministers (i.e., the member states).
It is possible that the French thought that a permanent Council President would be an appropriately inter-governmental counter-weight to a super-legitimate integrationist Commission President.
There are just two problems: first, an appointed President of the Council would have no particular legitimacy, he would be just another appointed official.
Second, his ostensible task--representing the EU abroad--must depend on a degree of agreement between the member states on foreign policy that is now completely absent.
On the contrary, even if a number of large member states talk up about a common foreign policy, they prove by their actions that they are determined to maintain their own national foreign policies.
In the run-up to the Iraq war, many member states refused even to consult their colleagues.
So even if the French and Germans get their way, the Council will have a President representing nobody but himself.
Of course, the future is unpredictable.
Even the British may learn to understand Europe, though no one should count on it.
But we should not overlook the fact that the Convention has slipped in quite a number of proposals which are inherently federalist.
These include the generalization of majority voting, enlargement of the European Parliament's role, the notion of public proceedings for the Council of Ministers (making it almost like a senate), the introduction of the possibility of withdrawal from the Union, and even the possibility of treaty ratification by majority.
These ideas may go nowhere, at least not right away.
But they reflect the fundamental reality that at every turning point, the EU has moved forward through more integration.
On his return from the signature of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997, Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary at the time, announced that "The federalists have been defeated."
Don't bet on it.
Current events show that the European Stability and Growth Pact is not very efficient and has failed to prevent several Member States from encountering serious problems in their balance of payments and in paying off their debt.
In addition to the aid provided to these countries by the EU, the institutions are therefore working to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact in order to avoid crises of this kind in the future.
That is the objective of the economic governance package, of which this report by my fellow Member Mrs Ford is a part.
The report deals with requirements for the budgetary frameworks of the Member States.
I supported this report, just as I support the economic governance package as a whole.

Mergers: Commission opens in-depth investigation into acquisition by Ineos of BP ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol business
The European Commission has opened a detailed investigation under the EU Merger Regulation into the planned acquisition by the UK company Ineos of the ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol businesses of BP at Dormagen (Germany).
The Commission’s preliminary market investigation has found that the proposed transaction could create significant competition concerns given the strong market position that Ineos would achieve on the ethylene oxide market.
The decision to open an in-depth inquiry does not prejudge the final result of the investigation.
Ineos is a UK based company active worldwide in the production, distribution, sales and marketing of intermediate and speciality chemicals.
The transaction has its main effects on the ethylene oxide market.
Ethylene oxide is used for the production of “ethylene glycols”, which are used for the production of polyester for the textile and film industries, antifreeze and plastic (polyethylene terephthalate - PET) bottles, and for the production of a number of other “ethylene oxide derivatives” used in a wide range of industries such as detergents, cosmetics, textile or paints.
After the planned transaction, Ineos would have a strong position in the supply of ethylene oxide.
The anticompetitive effect may be reinforced by the high utilisation rate of ethylene oxide production capacity.
On the basis of these concerns, the Commission has decided to open a second phase investigation in order to carry out an in-depth assessment of the effects of the transaction.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the admission of observers from Bulgaria and Romania to the European Parliament.
I believe that that is an extremely important step forward towards the day marking the full membership of these, the last two ex-Communist states, which, in my opinion, ought to have been accepted with the other eight countries on 1 May 2004.
Within the Italian national anthem is the line ‘’, which – I will say it for the benefit of the interpreters – means ‘let us all join together for the coming battles’.
The terrible news that we received a short while ago from London prompts me to say that, if all of the European Member States remain united, we will be able to defend ourselves far better from the insane attacks against democracy, as is happening at this very moment in London.
Madam President, today the EU Commission is demanding of the Irish Government savage cuts in Ireland's budget, involving the slashing of public services and the living standards of working people, possibly even for pensioners and the unemployed.
The Commission should know, however, that it is conspiring with the Irish Government in a lie to pretend that the money given to bail out the banks is not State aid while, at the same time, hammering the public sector.
However, Irish workers and community activists are fighting back.
Tens of thousands marched in protest last Friday; thousands of workers marched in Dublin today; and on 24 November, a public sector workers' strike is scheduled, in order to stop these attacks.
In view of the seriousness of the situation, that should now be upgraded to a 24-hour general strike to bring down this appalling government, which has no mandate for these policies, and to halt the policy of the Commission and of the Irish Government to slash and burn the living standards and services of working people.
Mr President, I love the word 'democracy' because it puts the word 'people' in front of the word 'rule' – government by the people, of the people, for the people.
I have heard the word 'democracy' repeated many times in Parliament and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on which I sit.
However, the word is empty without the reality.
I see little evidence of democracy in the strategies being designed to guarantee a positive outcome to the Constitution.
In the committee we are told that it is our job to 'sell the Treaty', that we should restrict the debate in our home countries, that referendums should be scheduled to maximise the 'yes' vote.
We are told that we must get the Council to supply funds for the pro-Constitution campaigns.
In committee draft questions were proposed to ask the Council to specify a strategy to ensure a positive outcome to the ratification procedure.
I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure.
I am sorry to say that 'fair and free' lost.
I turn to the Council, Commission and Parliament: if we believe in democracy – especially in this process that you, Mr President, called the most important since the founding of the Union – I entreat you to do whatever you can to ensure a fair and free process, to ensure that resources are used to truly inform people, especially by distributing copies of the Constitution to all the electorate, and by ensuring that all sides of the debate are thoroughly aired.
If we insist on democracy in this process – not just in word but in reality – then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept.
In the past few weeks about 70 searches have been carried out on business premises and at private homes in Italy, France and Belgium.
Investigations are continuing in order to determine the precise loss to the Community budget.
Butter is one of the most common ingredients in European food production, and is subsidised by the European Community.
The subsidies take the form either of "export refunds" paid when the product is exported to countries outside the Union, or of Community aid towards the processing of butter used in baking which is sold on the Community's home market.

New EU rules to sanction maritime polluters
“We can no longer tolerate intentional pollution or serious negligence by a small minority of operators who do not comply with international standards and tarnish the image of the maritime industry.
Vice-President Franco Frattini, responsible for Justice, Freedom and Security, highlighted the added value of a European approach to fight against ship-source pollution.
In particular, he stressed that for the first time all 25 Member States had agreed to criminalise the most serious conduct and provide for corresponding criminal sanctions.
The Directive establishes that marine pollution by ships is an infringement.
In the most serious cases, the Framework Decision provides that these infringements will have to be regarded as criminal offences, subject to criminal penalties.
The Directive tackles discharges in all sea areas including the high seas.
It is enforceable for all ships calling to EU ports irrespective of their flag.
The scheme also provides for cooperation between port State authorities which will make it possible for proceedings to be initiated in the next port of call.
The Framework Decision also contains special rules on jurisdiction.
The European Maritime Safety Agency will assist the Commission and Member States to that end.
In this context, the European Parliament and the Council have decided to consider in the near future how to reinforce synergies between enforcement authorities such as national coastguard services.
Cooperation is also enhanced in the criminal justice area.
The Framework Decision provides for a mutual mechanism of information exchange among EU Member States if one of them is aware of the risk of a criminal offence in another’s territory.

on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, a few days before the European Football Championship gets under way, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - and I hope the entire European Parliament - is showing forced prostitution the red card once again.
Up to 800 000 women throughout the world become victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation every year.
This is one of the worst human rights violations today and even at major sporting events, quick sex around the venues of football matches is also linked to this modern-day slavery.
Two years ago at the football World Cup in Germany, we initiated a wide-ranging debate here in Parliament and launched a campaign to ensure that the huge wave of forced prostitution the experts initially feared and the corresponding negative spin-offs were able to be prevented thanks to the support of the fans through the opinioned public.
However, the subject then disappeared from sight again.
We have introduced legal initiatives and, with the experience we have gained from the German campaign, supported very extensively by the women's organisations, have managed to set up victim protection measures and demonstrate the plight of the women who usually come from Central and Eastern Europe.
They are in dire straits as criminals on the one hand, since they do not have any residence permits, but as victims, on the other hand, because they are mercilessly exploited by the human traffickers.
We have moved on a step further with the victim protection measures, cross-border cooperation and the legitimate issuing of residence permits.
We now want to use the public at matches in Austria and Switzerland to highlight the subject again.
In Germany the Socialist Minister of Justice has announced draconian penalties for punters of forced prostitution.
There are still, however, many loopholes, and Parliament has to ensure that these loopholes are closed.
I would ask the Commission to support us in this.

Judgment in Case C-521/11
Amazon.com International Sales Inc. and Others v Austro-Mechana Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung mechanisch-musikalischer Urheberrechte Gesellschaft mbH
The indiscriminate collection of a private copying levy on the first sale of recording media may, under certain conditions, be compatible with EU law
In addition , under certain conditions, there may be a rebuttable presumption that recording media sold to individuals will be used for private purposes
According to EU law 1 , the Member States grant, in principle, authors, performers, producers and broadcasting organisations the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the reproduction of their works, fixations of their performances, their phonograms, their films and fixations of their broadcasts.
However, the Member States may provide for exceptions or limitations to those exclusive rights.
Accordingly, they may permit, in particular, the making of private copies.
A Member State which avails itself of this option must, however, provide that the rightholders receive ‘fair compensation’.
That compensation is to compensate rightholders for the reproduction, without their authorisation, of their protected works or other protected subject-matter.
Austro-Mechana , an Austrian copyright collecting society, brought an action against Amazon before the Handelsgericht Wien (Commercial Court, Vienna, Austria) for the payment of the blank cassette levy for recording media sold in Austria from 2002 to 2004.
It claimed an amount of €1 856 275 for the first half of 2004 and sought an order requiring Amazon to provide the accounting data necessary for it to quantify its claim for payment for the remainder of that period.
That judgment was upheld on appeal.
Amazon, which is of the view that the Austrian blank cassette levy is, for various reasons, contrary to EU law, brought the matter before the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court, Austria).
That court seeks a ruling from the Court of Justice on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of EU law.
It is accordingly for the Oberster Gerichtshof to verify in the present case, taking account of the circumstances of the Austrian system and the limits imposed by EU law 2 , whether practical difficulties justify such a system of financing of fair compensation and whether the right to reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment of the levy paid excessively difficult.
The possibility of a presumption of private use of recording media sold to individuals
The payment of half of the income from blank cassettes not directly to those entitled to fair compensation but to social and cultural institutions set up for their benefit
No account taken of a private copying levy already paid in another Member State
The Court ’s answer is that the obligation to pay a levy such as the blank cassette levy may not be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.
A person who has previously paid that levy in a Member State which does not have territorial competence to collect it may request its repayment in accordance with its national law.
NOTE: A reference for a preliminary ruling allows the courts and tribunals of the Member States, in disputes which have been brought before them, to refer questions to the Court of Justice about the interpretation of European Union law or the validity of a European Union act.
The Court of Justice does not decide the dispute itself.

Mr President, according to the voting lists, Amendment 464 from the Green/EFA Group will fall if Amendment 870 from the Committee on Budgets is adopted.
The voting list follows the rule introduced in formulae by Thomas von der Vring, according to which the amendments adopted by the Committee on Budgets shall be put to the vote first in plenary, and if these are adopted, all other amendments to the same budget line fall.
However, this practice, which is not included in Parliament's Rules of Procedure, was introduced for the sole purpose of ensuring that the overall position on the budget adopted by Parliament would remain within the financial limits set for the European Parliament.
As Amendment 464 only proposes to place funds in the reserve, it definitely cannot pose a problem of exceeding the limits.
In fact, the two amendments are in no way mutually exclusive and can therefore definitely both be voted on.
I therefore urge you to apply Rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure and also allow a vote on Amendment 464.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr Belder’s report makes a number of comments and proposals in line with the recommendations from the Council concerning relations between the Union and Russia.
I support the two main lines pursued in the report.
First, the reaffirmation of the desire to develop the vital partnership between the European Union and Russia.
Russia is a big country and it is essential to develop economic relations with her in the areas of industry, research, health and energy.
Common ambitions and objectives must be set, as the rapporteur proposes.
They are of strategic and political importance.
We must set priority objectives, such as cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, defence of human rights, democracy, independence of news media and the rule of law, cooperation to resolve conflicts in the region and disarmament; we must also promote improvements to public health and social development.
The second line pursued in the report seeks to be more critical, especially concerning basic freedoms and democratic rights in Russia.
I agree with the rapporteur when he deplores the weakness of the Union’s role in the Chechen conflict, which has caused more than 200 000 deaths in ten years and is really genocide.
The report calls on the Russian authorities to investigate the disappearances, torture and all violations of human rights.
In November 2003, several of us intervened following President Berlusconi’s statements justifying the Russian military’s intervention policy.
Europe must indeed play a much greater role in strongly and clearly condemning Russia in its handling of the war in Chechnya.
There will not and cannot be a military solution in Chechnya.
The desire for a partnership between the European Union and Russia must follow a plan that includes peace and security for all peoples.
Europe can no longer be content with mere rhetoric.
It must act and, from that point of view, the report is a step in the right direction.
Before voting on Amendment 13 with the slight semantic difference emphasised by Mr Speroni, we shall first vote on Amendments 1 and 10, which are exactly identical.
Brussels, 26 January 2001
As a result EU spirits such as whisky will no longer be discrimated against in the Chilean market.
This brings to an end more than 20 years of tax discrimination, ensuring that European spirits compete on equal footing with locally produced spirits, in particular pisco, in the Chilean market.
The new legislation provides for a final rate of 27% applicable to all spirits as from March 2003.
In the meantime, the tax rate for whisky (currently 47%) and other imported spirits such cognac will be progressively reduced to that level.
Background
Mr President, I shall not dispute the figures that Mr Corbett has just read out.
I do not particularly care if this Parliament costs less per capita than others - though I think there are one or two more people across the European Union than there might be in the United Kingdom.
My concern with this report is that it is a missed opportunity.
It highlights many of the expensive regimes that we have all noticed in our time here - I have been here for 10 years, like you, Mr President.
It is interesting, for example, that the European Parliament's main library is in Luxembourg, where no one can access it, because the Members rotate between Brussels, Strasbourg and their home seats.
There are lots of missed opportunities in this place, and this report is most definitely one of them.
At a time when all our constituents are having to tighten their belts, we should have signalled in this report that we were willing to tighten ours too, and we did not.
It is a missed opportunity.
This resolution is worrying and unacceptable.
This is particularly true in the context of the most recent events in Libya, which show the urgency of a peaceful and political solution like never before, without external interference.
In the face of the dangerous and severe build-up of actions, which, instead of helping to reduce tension, are aimed at preparation for acts of aggression by the US and NATO against Libya, the majority of Parliament is endorsing acts of interference, aggression and occupation in Libya.
Any aggression against this country, regardless of pretexts and mandates, would have serious consequences for a people that is already living in a situation of deep tension and insecurity.
It would be deeply damaging to all those in Libya who are continuing to fight for their rights, democracy, sovereignty and peace, and would introduce serious elements of instability and conflict into the region.
Any military attack on Libya, which would be inseparable from the aims of controlling the Libyans' natural resources, will be directed not only against the Libyan people, but against all the people in the region who have arisen and are continuing to fight for their social and political rights, for freedom, democracy and the real sovereignty and independence of their countries.
Thank you, Mr Gollnisch.
You may recall that for several months I sat as a non-attached Member and, if I may say so, my political views are so divergent from yours that it merely proves the point that the non-attached section is not a group, and never can be.
- At the end of the vote:
The next item is voting time.
(For results of the vote and other voting information: see Minutes)
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Leinen.
In fact, environmental and sustainability policies have recently taken on a particular relevance, making people pay greater attention to the integration of economic and environmental policies.
Climate change, sustainable transport, nature, biodiversity, the use and exploitation of raw materials and natural resources, as well as waste management, have increased their importance exponentially in the policies of Member States.
For this reason, we can only assess European environmental policies and the related strategies adopted within the EU in a serious and rigorous way if reliable data are provided.
– Mr President, I believe that anyone wanting to put a title to the opinions being expressed by certain Member States in the Council would choose the title: 'How to have more Europe with less money'.
This, in my view, simply cannot be done. I believe that there are numerous contradictions in the discussions being held in the Council and in the proposals by the British Presidency.
In this debate there is a huge contradiction between words and ambitions, on the one hand, and the fact that we only give the Community budget 2.5% of public spending in the 25 Member States, on the other.
Similarly, numerous Member States are putting the emphasis in this debate on how much money they personally give the Community budget.
However, these same Member States are forgetting what they receive, the net contributions, via the single market and via the Structural Funds, given that a significant portion of the budget of the Structural Funds finds its way back to these Member States in various ways, which everyone knows and I need not analyse.
In addition, farmers are being discussed.
If the common agricultural policy is ever revised, I propose to the British Presidency that we start with the large-scale farmers, who receive the lion's share of subsidies, rather than the poor farmers in the south, if we want the common agricultural policy to have a social content.
In all events, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on cohesion policy, I should like to say that Parliament has expressed its views. They are views that support a credible budget for cohesion, a cohesion policy without two tracks and with efficient management.
Parliament will not keep quiet; it is not prepared to accept every Council agreement, every decision taken next week; we are here to fight to the end for the cohesion policy and we shall exercise all our rights.
author. - Mr President, today President Buzek announced the winner of this year's Sakharov Prize.
This prize embodies freedom of thought, an essential European freedom and right we stand for on behalf of our citizens and across the world.
In response to the Nobel Peace Prize award, President Buzek called firmly on China to release Liu Xiao Bo and said: 'Freedom is not a threat, but the threats to freedom can be many'.
This also goes for the people who defend human rights in the Northern Caucasus.
Last year's Sakharov Prize awardees Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, of Memorial, have not been able to pick up their award personally as their freedom is threatened.
The EU invests tremendously in EU-Russia relations, and we are joined through the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
Russia has thus committed itself to protecting and promoting human rights and the rule of law, but what a long way we are from that situation.
Intimidation of journalists and civil society activists prevails, disappearances of human rights defenders happen systematically and there is no freedom of expression, including on the Internet.
The absence of the rule of law has led to 20 000 cases pending at the European Court of Human Rights from the Russian Federation.
Russia has the right to fight terrorism in the Northern Caucasus, but if the rule of law is not upheld this has a counter-productive effect on stability.
There really is no excuse for Russia not to comply with its own commitment to human rights.
We look forward and will see to it that the representatives of Memorial have the freedom to come to this Parliament, thereby symbolising the freedoms and rights that all citizens in the Northern Caucasus enjoy.
– Mr President, especially as the former mayor of a regional island town, I too wish, from this position, to thank the outgoing Commissioner, Mr Barnier, for his efforts to serve the idea of economic and social cohesion in the Europe of the regions.
Of course, I also thank Kostas Hatzidakis, my colleague and fellow countryman who acted as rapporteur for the report being debated, for his work which, as we all know, is manifested in more than just this report.
It is very positive to note that our Parliament accepts by an overwhelming majority firstly, that any renationalisation of regional policy would be devastating even to the very existence of the European Union, of which it is a basic connective fabric, secondly, that the so-called statistical effect of enlargement – of any enlargement – would be addressed in such a way as to ensure continuing support for the regions for which it was considered necessary before enlargement, in order not to interrupt their progress towards development, thirdly, that the special regions from the point of view of natural disadvantages will also need to receive special treatment and finally, that the cohesion policy, which is indeed an essential tool to enable the Union to achieve the Lisbon objectives, has provided important results to date.
It is therefore worth our while to continue this balanced, balancing, reliable and effective policy.
I should like to welcome to the official gallery Mr Norbert Lammert, who is the President of the Bundestag.
Mr Lammert has made his first visit this morning to the European Parliament since the last election of the Bundestag.
On behalf of this entire Chamber, I wish him a very warm welcome.
Democracy Over Sovereignty in Europe
MILAN – The future of the European Union may not officially be on the ballot in the upcoming elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy, but the results will go a long way towards determining Europe’s fate.
Anti-EU sentiment is more widespread than ever, as demonstrated by the feverish campaigns of right-wing populist insurgents like Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Marine Le Pen in France.
But there are also signs of support for revamping and reinventing the EU – a message being espoused by the likes of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Martin Schulz.
Any pro-EU campaign, to be convincing, must address the problems stemming from the euro.
Adopted by 19 of the EU’s 28 member countries (27, after Brexit), the common currency has become a major source of disillusionment with European integration.
Though the euro crisis, in its most acute form, is over, the eurozone remains a fragile construct.
In the event of renewed volatility, doubt about its survival could easily return.
At the root of the common currency’s fragility are flaws in the Maastricht Treaty framework, which dictates that eurozone members maintain a common monetary policy and individual fiscal policies that conform to shared fiscal rules.
But the mere existence of fiscal rules has proved insufficient to guarantee compliance, and there is no enforcement mechanism at the EU level to ensure adequate fiscal discipline.
Unless this changes, there will always be the risk that weaker members will accumulate unsustainable debts, forcing stronger members to choose between providing politically untenable transfers and allowing members to exit, creating instability that could bring down the entire project.
A victory for pro-European forces in the coming elections could provide the opportunity – perhaps the last opportunity – to pursue the changes to the Maastricht Treaty that are needed.
Those changes will not be easy to carry out.
Europeans will need to accept a fundamental shift in the basis of the eurozone’s legitimacy, moving beyond a simple commitment to rules-based economic governance to accept the kind of discretionary approach taken by an authority with democratic legitimacy.
Without political union, the adoption of a rules-based approach to governance is understandable.
It aligns with the logic of central-bank independence: unelected policymakers are committed to a straightforward set of rules, such as targeting a particular inflation rate, against which they can be held accountable.
But that logic hasn’t worked for the eurozone, where concrete rules have proved inadequate to prevent pressure for redistribution that voters do not support.
Now that this has become apparent, some advocate a greater role for the market in enforcing discipline.
Proposals for a new sovereign-lending framework that allows for orderly restructuring reflect this reasoning.
One proposal calls for the European Stability Mechanism to adopt a system similar to that of the International Monetary Fund, in order to prevent lending to insolvent countries and force reprofiling or restructuring after a certain debt threshold is crossed.
Such an approach would make the EU’s “no bailout” rule more credible and avoid placing an excessive burden on monetary policy.
But it would be naive to believe that such a scheme would solve the problem.
Fear of contagion would always be justified in a monetary union, where the externalities of a debt crisis in one country always risks infecting the rest of the union.
Given this, a framework based exclusively on market mechanisms would be prone to instability.
This is not to say that a market-driven debt-restructuring framework has no place in eurozone reform.
It does, and so does a set of simple common rules.
But, to support a shared fiscal stance and achieve a better mix of monetary and fiscal policy, a third component is needed: an independent federal fiscal authority focused on creating risk-sharing mechanisms.
Such an authority would need a small budget and some discretionary power, in order to be able to adjust its approach in response to events.
Of course, if such a system were perceived to be undermining member states’ sovereignty it would not be politically feasible.
Its critics would need to be convinced of its democratic legitimacy.
Without full political union, that could be achieved with an emphasis on transparency, independence, and a much larger role for the European Parliament, possibly in coordination with national parliaments.
After all, the central issue facing Europe is not sovereignty, as the right-wing populists claim, but democracy.
(With integrated markets, full national sovereignty is an illusion.)
What Europe needs today is a treaty that expands democratic legitimacy at the EU level.
Preserving national sovereignty based on institutions designed for the far less integrated European economy of the nineteenth century is a recipe for failure.
. Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising for failing to present a consistent report.
This report might be my last in this Parliament and, Commissioner, I am not proud of the result.
The Associated Countries Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia align themselves with this declaration. ***
Mr President, Lady Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament expresses its great regret that these presidential elections have turned into another missed opportunity for the country to set out firmly and with commitment on the road to democracy.
We can, however, say that essentially, the European Union's policy of gradually engaging Belarus on certain conditions has yielded certain results, so we should be wary of calls for a radical change to our policy.
I say this because it is thanks to our engagement that the presidential campaign ultimately made some progress, and it could be that it was also the reason why many more people gathered on the square in Minsk than the organisers had expected.
In other words, we had probably generated an atmosphere of greater freedom which the citizens of Belarus may have interpreted correctly.
However, from here on, we have to be, in the first place, clear and firm enough with our demands to the authorities in Belarus to free those detained and to immediately stop persecuting all those who took part in or organised the protests in one form or another.
We cannot compromise on this, and we have to be quite clear about what we want.
Anther element, however, is what we can do in the medium and long term.
Firstly, we have to avoid casting the country back into isolation, because in that way, as the representatives of the opposition and of civil society stressed, Belarus' isolation means the isolation of the country's citizens.
What we have to do is, within the framework of the policy we already have towards Belarus, to try and take certain measures to adjust our policy, so that it benefits the country's citizens and supports its media, civil society, the opposition.
In this way, we can create an environment in which fair and democratic elections will be possible.
We should, in my view, work towards this with Belarus' non-EU neighbours, Russia and Ukraine, and, as a parliament, try and use the opportunities provided by the Eastern Partnership and EURONEST to engage the other five countries in the Partnership in joint activities to democratise Belarus.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr President, if I had to define the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty, I would say, firstly, that it is integrationist; secondly, that it is based on free accession; thirdly, that it is respectful of different identities, cultures, languages and institutional structures and creates a European citizenship which does not exclude, but rather co-exists with, other citizens from the Member countries.
In the Basque country, our Parliament has just approved, by an absolute majority, a new Statute for co-existence with the Spanish State which, in fact, is inspired by the Community model, which maintains these same principles I have indicated and is respectful of the Constitutional Treaty.
Nevertheless, in this morning’s debate one Member has accused it of attacking the European Constitution and has said that the Basque President and the Basque Nationalist Party have allied themselves with the enemies of Europe.
That is entirely false.
We are going to support a ‘yes’ vote and we advocate a ‘yes’ to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the coming referendum.
And we want to be able to live together in peace and friendship with the other peoples of the Spanish State, on the basis of mutual respect for different identities and languages, free accession and common work within a united Europe.
We Basques have supported European integration from the outset, and we want to be more European and are working for a common future with all Europeans under the new Constitutional Treaty.

President Juncker said: "
We have been working for jobs and growth from day one of my mandate.
A recovery that is based on social fairness, and can deliver renewed convergence within and between Member States.
From the Investment Plan for Europe to the Energy Union, Digital Single Market, Capital Markets Union, to the completion of Economic and Monetary Union, our agenda is in full stream.
Social partners at national and EU levels are key to success."
Vice President Dombrovskis stressed the increased importance of the social partners.
"They are being consulted on a wider range of EU policies and initiatives at an earlier stage.
Together we can build on the European social market economy, making it more resilient and fair."
Commissioner Thyssen called the social partners "indispensable" for promoting growth and jobs.
"We need the expertise of the social partners to shape our policies".

on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner - to whom I would like to wish a happy birthday today - I am not going to refer to the text I was planning to read to you here on behalf of my group because I believe we are in the midst of a particularly important discussion.
By noting the failure to meet this Millennium goal, the fifth goal, which is very important because it concerns women and their suffering during pregnancy, we have to abandon the extremely hypocritical attitude and analysis we make in Europe when we know, see and can testify to the situation in Africa, on the ground, in villages, in countryside and in the bush.
I was rather annoyed by what our fellow Member Mr Kaczmarek has just said, and that is why I am not going to read my paper.
We cannot claim that abortion is a miraculous remedy for all the problems of women who have to give birth.
Absolutely not.
We have to devote the necessary means to ensuring that these women can have everything they need: an education, proper family planning, contraception and, where necessary, voluntary termination of pregnancy under proper conditions - but we are not going all-out for that.
It is extremely difficult to say things clearly in Parliament because there are some people who, in the name of morality and sometimes in the name of conservatism, keep stopping us from taking proper measures, effective measures, for the benefit of women in the countries concerned.

Background
Under Article 21 of the EC Merger Regulation, the Commission has exclusive competence to assess the competitive impact of concentrations with a Community dimension.
Member States cannot apply their national competition law to such operations.
Moreover, Member States cannot adopt measures which could prohibit or prejudice (de jure or de facto) such concentrations unless the measures in question:
protect interests other than competition and
are necessary and proportionate to protect interests which are compatible with all aspects of Community law.
Public security, plurality of media and prudential rules are interests that are recognised by the Merger Regulation as being legitimate, but specific national measures adopted on these grounds must still be proportionate and fully compatible with all aspects of Community law.
More information about this case is available at:

Mr President, from the outset, I have personally supported the original Commission proposal to repeal all eight directives without compensation.
I believe that the Commission proposal was a prime example of the right way to simplify European law and promote the approach of 'better regulation'.
We should not push for harmonisation in all areas at any price.
We should think about other regulatory instruments than just EU regulations, such as international standards, for example.
We should also deploy these alternative regulatory instruments in cases where they would be more effective.
With the introduction of regulations in the area of metrology, I would prefer a voluntary system of mutual recognition of national regulations, based on international standards, rather than a top-down centralised harmonisation.
I am sorry that Parliament, along with certain Member States, does not support this exceptional and liberal approach of the Commission, preferring instead a conservative approach to eliminating excessive regulation.
Despite everything, however, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for the effort she has devoted to finding a common compromise solution.
I applaud her personal enthusiasm, thanks to which the Commission proposal did not disappear from view, and part of the original intention at least has come through.
Mr President, the Council made a good decision on 3 October in favour of an arms embargo.
Uzbekistan does not need any weapons, which may be used to oppress its own population.
It is good that we are now demanding that an independent investigation be carried out into what happened in Andijan.
The media are tightly controlled, and the opposition and members of popular movements are prevented from meeting.
The demands we are making of President Karimov should not be so difficult to fulfil.
He needs only to comply with his own country’s constitution, which states that freedom of movement, association and assembly must prevail and that the courts must be independent.
It is not unreasonable to demand that a president comply with his own country’s constitution, and that is what we are demanding in this Chamber today.

European Capitals of Culture: strengthening the European identity
All the Member States, irrespective of the date of their accession to the European Union, must be treated equally.
The CoR therefore welcomes the modifications made by the Commission and which aim to enable the new Member States to take part in this event as soon as possible.
Strengthening European integration
Designating two European capitals, as suggested by the Commission, will indeed "better reflect the wealth and diversity of Europe’s cultures".
in writing. (SV) Even though Sweden decided, through a referendum, not to participate in economic and monetary union (EMU), we have chosen to vote against the report and would like to take the opportunity to explain why we have done so.
The report provides a clear picture of how EMU goes hand in hand with the creation of an EU state.
According to the report, macroeconomic policy between the countries of the euro area is to be coordinated, and the euro area is to speak with one voice in international financial institutions and fora.
The report advocates better fiscal, especially budgetary, coordination and the coordination of national fiscal calendars.
Moreover, the objective of introducing a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in Europe could be achieved through the mechanism of enhanced cooperation if Member States were unable to reach unanimous agreement.
We can only conclude that the representatives of the 'no' campaign in Sweden's EMU referendum in 2003 were entirely correct in their argument when they pointed out that EMU was a major step on the road to a United States of Europe.
It refers to some types of credit default swaps.
The European Commission has adopted a new set of rules that requires certain over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivative contracts to be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs).
Mandatory central clearing is a vital part of the response to the financial crisis; it follows commitments made by world leaders at the G-20 Pittsburgh Summit in 2009 to improve transparency and mitigate risks.
Jonathan Hill, EU Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said: "
Today’s decision marks another step towards making good on our G20 commitments to bolster financial stability, reduce risks and boost market confidence."
Today's decision takes the form of a Delegated Regulation and implements part of the clearing obligations set out in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation ('EMIR').
This creates an environment that is more conducive to investment and economic growth in the EU.
This clearing obligation will enter into force subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
It will be phased in over three years to give extra time for smaller market participants to comply.
Background
Derivatives play an important role in the economy but are associated with certain risks.
Recent financial crises have highlighted that these risks are not sufficiently mitigated in the over-the-counter (OTC) part of the market, especially in regards to credit default swaps (CDS).
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the Commission has been working to address these risks.
CCPs clear the transactions between two parties, helping to manage the risk that can arise if one party defaults on its payments.
This in turn creates an environment more conducive to investment and economic growth in the EU.
According to Article 5 of EMIR, the European Commission, on the basis of a proposal from the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA), should determine the types of OTC contracts that should be subject to mandatory clearing by a CCP.
The Commission 2016 Work Programme includes a commitment to legislate for a European framework for the recovery and resolution of CCPs.

I believe it is of the greatest importance for EU agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market in sugar, to be reformed.
The present system costs a lot of money.
Moreover, today’s high agricultural subsidies involve EU products being dumped on the world market, something that has serious consequences for the developing countries.
Today, the European Parliament has voted on a resolution subsequent to an oral question put by Mr Daul and Mr Fruteau.
I chose to vote against the resolution as a whole since it is mainly oriented towards maintaining the status quo.
Sugar producers in certain developing countries too will be affected by the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar. The current system is not entirely to their disadvantage.
Their situation should not, however, be remedied through a less far-reaching reform of the sugar market.
Instead, these countries should be supported through other measures such as increased development cooperation and technical trade support.
(FR) Mr Barroso, all the same, the question was clear.
I was not asking you a question about a hypothetical referendum, but about a referendum that is identical in every way to the one that was held for the people of Switzerland.
If one of the EU Member States, in a completely identical referendum, asked the question that was asked of the Swiss people, how would the Commission react?
Do they have the right to do so?
And would the Commission oppose the decision of the sovereign people if it decided to vote as the Swiss did?
The question is clear.
The Commission will examine whether the cooperation restricts competition and thereby harms innovation in breach of EU antitrust rules.
EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager said: "
Network sharing agreements can bring about efficiencies, such as reduced deployment costs and may allow for network expansion to previously unserved areas.
But, in some circumstances, network sharing may also reduce competition on the market.
The network sharing agreement between the two major operators in the Czech Republic covers most of the country.
We need to ensure that it will not reduce infrastructure competition and innovation.”
O2 CZ and T-Mobile CZ are both major telecoms operators in the Czech Republic.
Together, they serve approximately three quarters of the Czech retail mobile telecommunications market.
O2 CZ's mobile infrastructure and wholesale business has been transferred to CETIN, a new network infrastructure company belonging to the same corporate group.
The network sharing cooperation between O2 CZ/CETIN and T-Mobile CZ started in 2011 and has been increasing in scope.
The Commission will now investigate in particular whether the cooperation between O2 CZ/CETIN and T-Mobile CZ risks slowing down quality improvements in existing infrastructure, and delaying or hindering the deployment of new technologies, such as 4G/LTE and future technologies, and new services based on them, in particular in densely populated areas.
If this were the case, the cooperation would be contrary to EU Treaty rules that prohibit anticompetitive business practices (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) to the extent that it concerns behaviours that restrict competition.
The Commission will also investigate the impact of potential efficiencies that could be brought about by the network sharing.
The opening of proceedings means that the Commission will examine the case as a matter of priority.
Background
O2 CZ is a major telecoms operator in the Czech Republic, with more than six million lines, both fixed and mobile.
T-Mobile CZ is a mobile communications subsidiary of the Deutsche Telekom group, operating in the Czech Republic since 1996.
O2 CZ and T-Mobile CZ are the two largest operators, with approximately three quarters of subscribers.
Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement prohibit agreements and concerted practices which may affect trade and prevent or restrict competition.
The fact that the Commission has opened proceedings does not mean it has conclusive proof of antitrust violations.
Article 11(6) of the Antitrust Regulation provides that the initiation of proceedings by the Commission relieves the competition authorities of the Member States of their competence to also apply EU competition rules to the practices concerned.
Article 16(1) of the same Regulation provides that national courts must avoid giving decisions which would conflict with a decision contemplated by the Commission in proceedings it has initiated.
There is no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anti-competitive conduct.
More information on the investigation will be available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number 40305.

(DA) Mr President, the question that I would put to the climate sceptics in this House is this: if nine out of ten doctors told you they were more than ninety percent sure that you were seriously ill, but that they had some medicine that could cure your illness - a medicine with no side effects - would you take the medicine?
Of course you would.
That is how the world should have reacted in Copenhagen.
That is how the world should of course react when more than ninety percent of leading researchers in the field say that global warming is real and that it is man-made.
The EU should therefore demonstrate leadership.
Obviously, we can criticise the US.
Obviously, we can criticise China for not having had the political will required in Copenhagen.
In this House, however, we must look nearer home - we must be critical of the lack of initiative shown by the EU.
The EU could have done two things, and it should do two things before the conference in Mexico.
Firstly, we should take the lead as regards committing ourselves to reduction targets.
No, Mr Callanan, it would be crazy not to raise our ambitions!

EU Solidarity Fund, Hurricane Dean: Commission proposes aid worth €12.8 million for Martinique, Guadeloupe
The European Commission today proposed to grant aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) amounting to EUR 12.78 million in the aftermath of Hurricane Dean, which caused severe damage in the French Antilles islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe in August 2007.
Danuta Hübner, Commissioner for Regional Policy and the Solidarity Fund, conveyed her sympathy to those affected by the disasters.
She said: “
The outermost regions of the European Union are often vulnerable to natural disasters.
We are aware that Martinique and Guadeloupe are still affected by the damage Dean caused, especially in housing and plantations, hence the Union’s financial support”.
In Martinique, banana plantations were almost entirely destroyed and sugar cane suffered severely, thus hitting the by far most important sectors of agricultural production with a knock-on impact on the processing sector.
While the estimated damage of some EUR 511 million remained limited, the consequences of the storm will be felt for some time in these regions.
The Commission also took into consideration their specific status as outermost regions and the handicaps they face due to their distant and isolated location.
Background
The EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, grants aid to Member States and acceding countries in the event of a major natural disaster.
To make the funds available, the Commission is now requesting that the Budget Authority (European Parliament and Council) adopt an Amending Budget.
The conditions for implementing the aid will then be laid down in an agreement between the Commission and the French authorities.

The press have been writing about the US Government’s data mining of private financial records held by SWIFT, but they have not informed us whether this concerns SWIFT in the USA or whether it also applies to Europe.
If this is about SWIFT in the USA, then that is none of our business.
Access to SWIFT data in Europe is a matter administered primarily by Belgian authorities, who should grant all applications for access.
At present, the only thing we know is that SWIFT is supposed to share with the USA certain information related to the financing of terrorism.
There are two problems here.
Firstly, the European Parliament cannot engage in a serious debate about this issue merely on the basis of press coverage and vague statements.
Secondly, it has to abide by its treaties and be aware of its areas of jurisdiction.
We know that the Belgian authorities have launched an investigation into this, but do not yet have any results.
One thing we need to clarify is that access to the SWIFT system does not mean that ordinary transactions, such as the depositing and withdrawal of cash, cheques, electronic means of payment etc., are subject to data mining.
The Socialists and a number of other political groups think otherwise.
They have submitted a joint proposal for a resolution in which they state that US authorities have access to the records held by SWIFT and that this was an instance of the USA violating fundamental provisions on personal data protection.
These words are not, as Mr Wiersma says, assumptions, because they bandy them around as if they were facts.
Similarly, they have disregarded the fact that the Belgian Government is in charge of investigating the case and that the European Parliament has no role to play at this stage.
So, in order to preserve the dignity of the European Parliament and out of respect for EU’s , we, members of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, have adopted our own resolution in which we call everyone’s attention to the rules of the game and in which we say that we should only have recourse to such resolutions when we can operate with incontrovertible facts.
This is the only way for the European Parliament to preserve its reputation in the public eye and ensure it does not turn into a glorified debating society.
I support the views of Commissioner Frattini and call on Members of the Parliament to support our resolution as it complies fully with the and the ethics and standards of conduct of the European Parliament.
Mr President, the ECB's monetary policy operated in a rather uncertain and challenging environment in 2003.
In the first half of the year, real GDP growth stagnated amid considerable uncertainty related to geopolitical tensions and turbulence in oil prices and financial markets.
Following the easing of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, prospects for economic activity gradually brightened after the summer of 2003.
Nevertheless, overall GDP in the euro area increased by only 0.5% in 2003.
Annual HICP inflation slowed down slightly in 2003 to 2.1% on average from 2.3% on average in both 2001 and 2002.
The persistence of inflation above 2% was mainly caused by increases in a number of volatile components of the HICP, in particular oil prices, and, in the second half of 2003, food prices.
Rises in indirect taxes and administrative prices also added to inflation in 2003.
From a medium-term perspective, however, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability after the progressive elimination of the influence of those volatile components of the HICP.
This expectation resulting from our economic analysis was in line with our monetary analysis.
Much of the strength of monetary growth in early 2003 was due to the high level of economic and financial market uncertainty prevailing at that time, which prompted portfolio shifts into safer, short-term liquid assets included in M3.
In view of the moderation of medium-term inflationary pressures in the first half of 2003, as was said by Mr Lipietz, the ECB's key interest rates were reduced by 25 basis points in March 2003 and by 50 basis points in June of the same year.
Thus, in June 2003, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2%.
Since then, this interest rate has remained unchanged at this historically very low level, whilst the preservation of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability has contributed very significantly to the low level of medium and long-term nominal and real interest rates.
The resulting yield curve has delivered a financial environment very significantly supportive to economic recovery.
The economic recovery, which started in the second half of 2003, has continued this year.
In terms of year-on-year growth rates, we reached 2% in the second quarter of this year.
By and large, output growth in the last 12 months was close to present estimates of potential growth in the euro area.
We expect a continuation of this growth trend in the coming quarters.
On the external side, the world economy is currently recording its strongest growth for 30 years.
Some moderation is expected next year, but euro area exports should, nevertheless, continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions in 2005.
On the domestic side, investment should normally benefit from the positive global environment, the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area and the improvements in corporate efficiency.
There is scope in the euro area as a whole for a strengthening of private consumption, but naturally some uncertainty as to outlook exists.
One of the risks stems from developments in oil markets.
If oil prices were to remain high, or even to increase further, they could dampen the strength of the recovery, both inside and outside the euro area, despite the fact that the oil intensity of the euro area is significantly lower than in the 1970s.
We also need to keep in mind that part of the oil price increase is due to strong global demand, which was not the case in the first and second oil shocks, but it remains true that the oil price increase constitutes an adverse supply shock for the euro area economy as a whole.
For the oil price shock to be absorbed smoothly, the policy mistakes of the past must not be repeated and, in particular, 'second-round' effects must be avoided.
As regards consumer prices, oil-market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area HICP.
Following an annual rate of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2004, inflation reached 2.3% in the second quarter and 2.2% in the third quarter.
Inflation rates over the past year have also been driven up by exceptionally strong rises in indirect taxes and administered prices all over the euro area.
Nevertheless, looking ahead, the available information does not indicate -– in our eyes – that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically as yet.
Wage developments have remained moderate since the last quarter of 2003, and this trend should continue.
Provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in the course of 2005.
However, I should stress that, over recent quarters, we have seen several upward risks to the outlook for price stability emerge, and these call for ongoing vigilance.
This again relates to oil price developments and possible second-round effects stemming from wage- and price-setting behaviour.
Other concerns relate to long-term inflation expectations and also monetary trends.
Indeed, the downward trend in annual entry growth since mid-2003 appears to have halted over the summer of this year and the shorter-term dynamics of entry have strengthened.
This reflects in part the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion.
The low level of interest rates is also fuelling the growth of credit to the private sector, and we have witnessed continued strong growth in loans for house purchase.
Given the strength of M3 growth over the past few years, there is presently substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth.
I now turn to other aspects we are looking at.
A good and credible monetary policy is certainly a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation, but not a sufficient condition by itself.
Other conditions must be met, in particular sound fiscal policies and appropriate structural reforms.
In this respect, in the area of fiscal policy, last year proved disappointing.
The average fiscal deficit in the euro area increased from 2.4% to 2.7%.
Moreover, the fiscal situation remained of great concern in countries that had already recorded significant imbalances in 2002.
The aggregate euro area fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is not expected to improve in 2004 and the average debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to deteriorate further.
This is certainly a source of concern.
Last year fiscal policies in the EMU faced a number of serious challenges.
On 25 November 2003 the EU Council decided not to act on the basis of the Commission's recommendation and agreed to hold the excessive deficit procedure for the countries concerned in abeyance.
On the very same day, the Governing Council of the ECB supported the view of the Commission.
The Stability and Growth Pact is the cornerstone of EMU.
It is key to providing an economic to a single currency area which has no federal government and to ensuring macro-economic stability on a sustainable basis.
The Governing Council of the ECB is of the opinion that substantial improvements in the Pact's implementation are needed, particularly as regards the preventive arm of the Pact.
At the same time, it is not in favour of making changes to the text of the Treaty or of the regulations which form the basis of the Pact, and we insist on the importance of preserving the full integrity of the nominal anchor of 3% in the corrective arm of the Pact.
I would also stress – as has Ecofin – the vital importance of a reliable and timely reporting of government finance statistics, which would not be subject, in any respect, to political interference and electoral cycles.
On that particular point we are in full agreement with Ecofin.
On a more positive note, both 2003 and 2004 have seen some progress towards structural reforms in several euro area countries.
While implementing these reforms has not always been easy, I am confident that we will be able to see their positive effects in the years ahead.
I have said clearly that the ECB is backing governments, parliaments and social partners that have embarked on those necessary reforms in the euro area.
We cannot be complacent.
In many areas further reforms are needed.
The continuing reform process is key to enhancing the euro area's production potential and ensuring future growth and employment opportunities.
The year 2003 was also marked by the final preparations for the enlargement of the European Union by 10 new Member States, with effect from 1 May 2004.
As far as the ECB is concerned, the integration of the central banks of the 10 new Member States proceeded smoothly.
Important challenges remain for these countries on the road to adopting the euro.
Last week, the ECB, like the Commission, published the first Convergence Report dealing with these countries, together with Sweden.
The report identifies several priority areas in which individual countries will be required to make further efforts before they can adopt the euro.
The picture that emerged varied significantly from country to country, but many share similar challenges with regard to price stability, fiscal sustainability, exchange rate stability and interest rate convergence.
In addition, institutional convergence has not yet been achieved in all countries, in particular in the area of central bank independence.
I cannot over-emphasise the latter's importance for the successful conduct of monetary policy.
The ECB very much appreciated the favourable comments contained in the European Parliament's draft resolution on the ECB's monetary policy strategy in 2003.
We have always strived to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our primary objective of price stability.
Inflation has remained subdued, despite a sequence of adverse disturbances.
I do not want to dwell further on that, but I will stress the challenge of solidly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations – of key importance for delivering price stability and for consolidating an exceptionally favourable yield curve, because, on a medium to long-term basis, these inflationary expectations are incorporated in the market rates.
I have noted that on the most important issues the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB.
Nevertheless, there are a number of issues where we have slight differences of views.
In particular, the draft resolution asks for the publication of the minutes of the Governing Council meetings, whilst it seems to accept implicitly that individual votes of Members would not be made public.
We would very much appreciate it if Parliament could accept the argument that the publication of the votes of individual members of the Governing Council could trigger national public debates on whether national central bank governors have taken due account of national interests, whereas the Treaty calls for all of us to focus on the euro area as a whole.
Such public discussions would have adverse consequences for the credibility and the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy.
As regards the minutes, I stress that the ECB presents and explains its monetary policy decisions by means of comprehensive public statements at its press conferences which take place immediately after Governing Council meetings.
By adopting this procedure during 1999, the ECB contributed to improving the global state-of-the-art in central bank transparency and became the first central bank to release a comprehensive diagnosis explaining monetary policy decisions immediately after they are taken.
The information conveyed by the ECB this way is, in essence, similar to what other central banks publish in summary minutes, as it reflects properly the overall discussion in the Governing Council.
The ECB is the only major central bank which makes possible immediate interaction with the media.
These features make the ECB, in our view, one of the most transparent central banks in the world.
I am pleased with the 2011 draft budget, which is being discussed today, as it dwells precisely on the stated priorities.
For the first time, Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council on these matters.
This is the first budget following the Treaty of Lisbon.
For this reason, and due to the crisis that Europe is experiencing, it is important that the reconciliation process is successful.
It is vital that the EU is given a budget for the implementation of priority areas and the new powers that were bestowed upon it by the treaty.
It is important to fight for our convictions and for a budget that is visionary in a time of crisis.
Parliament's proposal reflects this ambition.
On the other hand, the values proposed by the Council mirror the austerity of budgets adopted at a national level within the EU.
The EU, however, must have the ability to react to policy changes caused by major challenges.
The EU has a duty to present an ambitious European budget which can assist economic recovery.
Only by strengthening areas such as science and innovation, and by contributing to economic growth and to more and better jobs, can we make Europe a more attractive place to live and work.
– Mr President, I wish to express my satisfaction with all the findings and proposals set out by the rapporteur and to make a number of comments.
We all know that inshore fishing is the basic economic activity in disadvantaged and isolated regions of the European Union.
For example, in Greece, inshore fishing has the largest number of boats (96% of the fishing fleet) and the highest rate of employment.
The sector needs financial support in order to replace and update the fleet.
The arrival of young workers in inshore fishing, apart from any family connections they may have, means that certain support policies need to be applied, given that even the report talks of the financial difficulties of both owners and workers and their limited borrowing capacity, factors which have an adverse impact on attracting young people to this profession.
In addition to vocational training, this policy could include specific incentives for young fishermen.
The role and contribution of women in family inshore fishing businesses needs to be acknowledged.
The European Union should help to organise inshore fishing by helping their associations to create infrastructures, move products and improve fishing methods.
It should be pointed out here that their organisation prevents them from being properly represented in decision-making bodies and at public hearings.
The active participation of coastal organisations throughout the European Union in a dialogue during which priorities and completion deadlines at local, regional and European level are determined must therefore be one of our objectives during the consultations.

Homelessness in Europe: "
Economic growth must not leave anyone by the wayside"
How should government action be framed to ensure a more mutually-supportive society?
On Wednesday 6 October, the CoR invited Laurette Onkelinx, Belgian minister for social affairs and president in office of the Social Policy and Health Council, to discuss European social policy with European local and regional elected representatives in Brussels.
Tore Hult's own-initiative opinion on combating homelessness is part and parcel of the political activities launched by the CoR during the European year against poverty and social exclusion.
The CoR invited the Belgian minister for social integration, Laurette Onkelinx to represent the presidency in office of the EU at the adoption of this key opinion.
"Social services of general interest play a pivotal role in European society and are largely responsible for achieving the EU's fundamental objectives, such as social, economic and territorial cohesion, social inclusion and economic growth.
However, a legal framework based solely on the logic of the market economy is not suited to the organisational structure of social services.
The Belgian presidency wants to give social services of general interest a proper framework and more legal certainty,".
CoR rapporteur Tore Hult stressed that in the CoR's view, combating homelessness should be a priority for the EU's social inclusion policy and the Europe 2020 strategy.
"Good quality, affordable housing is a fundamental need as well as a right.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledges that everyone has the right to social and housing assistance.
A high level of homelessness is unworthy of the EU."
The main obstacle to combating homelessness is the panoply of policies involved and the division of responsibilities between authorities.

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the 25 fellow Members who signed a letter to the Cambodian Prime Minister and dictator Hun Sen, bringing up the case of Saumura Tioulong, one of the leaders of the Sam Rainsy Party.
I would also like to bring this case to the attention of the Commission.
We have information that there is a real risk that Saumura Tioulong, who is also a member of the non-violent radical party, will be arrested in Cambodia.
So far it has not happened, and I hope this is partly due to the intervention of my fellow Members, but it is a situation that needs to be monitored very closely.
I would also like to use this time to let the President and all my fellow Members know that the Chinese embassy sent us all a letter which speaks of the separatist nature of the Dalai Lama's 'gang' which, according to this letter, would by nature be violent.
It seems to me that this is one of the statements and ideas we need to help the Chinese regime to overcome in order to bring democracy to China, Tibet and elsewhere.

ITEMS DEBATED
AUDIOVISUAL
TV without frontiers
Following a long discussion, a compromise text was agreed that was supported by all delegations except Sweden, Ireland, Latvia, Belgium, Lithuania, Luxemburg and Austria.
The Commission, Austria, Germany and Italy stated their intention of adding statements to the Council minutes.
The text agreed seeks to address the significant technological and market developments of recent years while ensuring a competitive level playing field between service providers.
It establishes common minimum rules for all audiovisual media services irrespective of the transmission platform used for their delivery.
Only the common minimum rules would apply to on-demand services, whilst additional rules, including the quantitative rules on advertising, would apply to television broadcasts.
The text of the general approach would modernise and simplify the quantitative rules on television advertising by giving more flexibility to broadcasters with regard to the insertion of advertising.
However, the draft directive would not increase the hourly amount of admissible advertising and it would continue to limit possible interruptions for cinematographic works, television films and news programmes.
Specific restrictions on the interrruption of children's programmes by advertising are also retained.
The general approach would introduce into the Directive rules on the issue of product placement.
In principle such a practice would be forbidden, but Member States would be free to derogate from this prohibition for certain categories of programmes, subject to strict conditions to protect the viewer.
Like the existing directive, the general approach continues to use the principle of country-of-origin to determine jurisdiction between Member States.
However, the text agreed includes a Community mechanism allowing a "destination" Member State in certain limited circumstances to take measures against a provider established in another Member State.
Co-operation between Member States in their handling of services provided across frontiers is also mandatory.
Legal basis proposed: Articles 47 and 55 of the Treaty – qualified majority required for a Council decision; co-decision procedure with the European Parliament applicable.
Digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material, and digital preservation - Council conclusions
Considering that:
cultural heritage and cultural content and expressions embody and convey the European Union's common and fundamental values and demonstrate Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity;
cultural content plays a key social and economic role.
There is a real demand for digital content among citizens as well as within the research community.
Digitisation and online accessibility of our cultural heritage can fuel creative efforts and support activities in other sectors, such as learning and tourism, thereby enhancing competitiveness and growth across Europe in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
to avoid duplication of efforts and to create synergies, coordinated action at Community level is imperative; this action must nevertheless take into account that current levels of progress and coordination in Member States regarding digitisation of content and digital preservation vary considerably, as do the national priorities in these areas.
the Commission Communication and Recommendation on 'the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material, and digital preservation' as part of the i2010: digital libraries initiative.
the underlying strategic objectives and main elements of the Commission Recommendation on the Digitisation and Online Accessibility of Cultural Material, and Digital Preservation.
the vision of a European Digital Library as a common multilingual access point to Europe's distributed - i.e. held in different places by different organisations - digital cultural heritage, hospitable to all types of cultural material (texts, audiovisual, museum objects, archival records etc.) and targeted at delivering rapidly a critical mass of resources to the users.
the variety of efforts ongoing in Member States to digitise and make accessible online the content of their archives, libraries and museums, as well as their different stages of progress.
the valuable coordination work done by the National Representatives Group on digitisation (NRG) to exchange Member States' experiences and monitor progress, inter alia through the Dynamic Action Plan[2]
the need to anchor this coordination work within the Community's institutional framework.
the instrumental work done at European level by CENL (the Conference of European National Librarians);
in organising and creating The European Library (TEL) as a gateway to the collective resources of national libraries across Europe;
in carrying this work forward towards the creation of the European Digital Library
the work ongoing in the Michael[3] and Michael Plus projects in describing and linking digital collections of museums, libraries and archives from different Member States and providing access to these collections;
that future work should be based on these and related initiatives, towards the goal of achieving a balanced cooperation between libraries, museums and archives;
that while making from the outset conceptual and technical preparations for all categories of cultural material (texts, audiovisual, museum objects, archival records etc.), the European Digital Library may exploit in its early stages the potential of a critical mass of multilingual textual material;
the importance of undertaking work in the field of digitisation, preservation and availability of content with full respect for Community and international legislation in the field of intellectual property.
of the Commission intention to carry out studies on progress in the digitisation of culture within the European Union, on the socio-economic impact of long-term preservation of digital resources, and on the socio-economic impact of public domain resources;
of the Commission intention to co-finance a network of centres of competence for digitisation and digital preservation under the 7th Framework programme for Research and development.
To address the issues related to digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation identified in the Commission Recommendation, and in particular those aspects highlighted in these conclusions;
As first steps, in line with the indicative timeline in Annex and taking into account the different starting points in the Member States, to
reinforce national strategies and targets for digitisation and digital preservation;
contribute to the European digital library, a multilingual common access point to Europe's distributed cultural heritage;
improve framework conditions for digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation;
reinforce co-ordination within and between Member States on related issues;
contribute to an effective overview of progress at European level.
As first steps and in line with the indicative timeline in Annex , to
timulate and co-ordinate work towards a European digital library as a common multilingual access point to Europe's distributed digital cultural heritage;
contribute to improved policy co-ordination on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation, in particular through the creation of a group of Member States' representatives to take forward the coordination work of the NRG within the Community's institutional framework, securing continuity - including effective transitional arrangements - and building on the experience and expertise gained.
address framework conditions for digitisation, online accessibility and digital preservation.
assess overall progress in the Member States on the relevant themes taking into account their different starting points; and to assess overall progress towards the European digital library and to report to the Council accordingly.

CULTURE
European Capital of Culture
Cities designated for 2010
The Council will appoint Mr Thomas ANGYAN (Austria) and Mr Seppo KIMANEN (Finland) as members of the "European Capitals of Culture 2011" selection panel representing the Council.
It should be recalled that under Decision 1419/1999/EC, each year the Commission forms a selection panel, composed of seven leading independent figures who are experts on the cultural sector, which issues a report on the designation of cities as Capitals of Culture.
Under Decision 2000/C9/01[6], each of the two Member States holding the Presidency during the ongoing year nominates a leading figure with a view to their appointment by the Council as its representatives in the selection panel for the following year.
Economy of culture in Europe
This discussion paper was based on a study prepared for the Commission by a consultant (KEA European Affairs[7] ) on the economy of culture.
An executive summary was released in mid-October and the full study was made available by the Commission at the end of October.
The framework within which this debate took place is the current Work Plan for Culture 2005-2006, adopted by the Council in 2004 which includes as one of its priorities the contribution of creativity and cultural industries to European growth and cohesion.
The Council was invited to discuss three main issues.
The need for harmonised cultural statistics at European level.
How would delegations assess the recommendations presented in the study and what were the delegations' views on the economy of culture and creative industries within the framework of the Lisbon agenda.
In introducing the debate, the Commission presented a timetable for the preparation of a policy document to be published in Spring 2007.
It is expected that the outcomes of this Ministerial debate would provide valuable input to this Communication and that, at the same time, it would be of relevance to the public consultation to be held in December.
The Commissioner further mentioned that the role of culture is growing in importance and that the study can form a solid basis for renewed discussion as it highlights the important contribution culture could make to the Information and communications technologies sector and to regional development.
More importantly, the Commissioner highlighted that the study proved the relevance of culture to achieve the goals of the Lisbon agenda.
A reference during the Spring European Council to the importance of culture could help to bring the issue forward.
In its summary of the debate the Presidency concluded that there was wide consensus between Member States on the importance of harmonised cultural statistics at European level that would allow a solid assessment of the economic impact of culture.
In this respect there was a need for close cooperation between Member States on defining a clear methodological basis.
Member States agreed generally that reliable evidence is needed in order to persuade all stakeholders to include culture and creativity into the context of policy making.
The Presidency further concluded that two important recommendations had been highlighted during the debate.
One of them was to strengthen the internal market for artists, for example by tackling taxation rules.
The other one was to support small and medium enterprises that create cultural content.
YOUTH
Better understanding and knowledge of youth
Summarising the debate, the Presidency emphasised that the development of youth policies was conditional upon obtaining reliable information - both quantitative and qualitative - through independent research.
Such research should focus on areas of relevance to political decision-making in the youth field.
The development of coordinated horizontal youth policies and their practical implementation should be promoted by means of a better structured dialogue between relevant actors in the youth field, which in turn implied developing a culture of consultation and dialogue between all interested parties.
Networking of this kind could help improve knowledge in the youth field in an efficient manner, as well as facilitate informed policy making.
To that end, the development of national networks covering policy, research, youth work and young people was to be encouraged.
Finally, the role of the European Knowledge Centre for Youth Policy was underlined, as was the importance of maintaining the quality and reliability of its work by ensuring the supply of reliable, up-to-date information via the national correspondents.
EDUCATION
Modernising Higher Education in Europe
Many delegations welcomed this opportunity for a debate at European level as a complement to national reforms currently being implemented or considered.
Emphasising the importance of higher education institutions for future economic growth and employment, they broadly endorsed the need for greater autonomy and accountability of those institutions and for stronger links between them and the business community.
Various delegations favoured more peer-learning initiatives, such as that contained in the United Kingdom's proposal for a compendium to be compiled of good practice in the field of higher education reform, based on Member States' and other countries' experiences.
With regard to the EIT, while most delegations were able broadly to welcome the initiative there was recognition that a large number of practical details remained to be examined , notably those concerning its funding and administration, its compatibility with existing networks and its competence to award degrees.
Enhanced European cooperation on Vocational Education Training (VET) - Council conclusions
The Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States adopted the following conclusions:
"The Council of the European Union and the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council,
This included a series of common tools and principles[10].
The Maastricht Communiqué set out priorities at national and European level and linked the Copenhagen process more firmly with the 'Education and Training 2010' work programme;
3. since the adoption of the Maastricht Communiqué, the EUROPASS single framework for the transparency of qualifications and competencies and the Council Conclusions on the role of development of skills and competences have been adopted[11].
Consultation on the European Qualifications Framework has been successfully completed and work has continued on developing a credit transfer system for VET (ECVET) which is now the subject of a public consultation.
4. the revised Lisbon strategy and its integrated guidelines for growth and jobs 2005 – 2008[12] reflect the central role of education and training within the European Union's agenda.
It calls on the Member States to expand and improve investment in human capital and to adapt education and training systems in response to the challenges posed by globalisation, demographic change and technological innovation.
5. the 2006 joint interim report on progress under the 'Education and Training 2010' work programme[13] concludes that "the improvement of the quality and attractiveness of VET continues to be a key challenge for the future".
It also states that "the search for excellence ....should go hand in hand with a search for greater access and social inclusion";
EMPHASISE that
1. vocational education and training should provide a broad knowledge and skills base relevant to working life, highlighting at the same time excellence at all levels.
Policies and practices should assess the relative impacts of investing in different levels of skills and competences.
The supply of intermediary and technical skills as well as high level skills should be increased to overcome skills shortages and to help sustain innovation and the growth of the knowledge society;
VET policies should address all sections of the population, offering attractive and challenging pathways for those with high potential, while at the same time addressing those at risk of educational disadvantages and labour market exclusion – especially early school leavers, those with low qualifications or no qualifications at all, those with special needs, people with an immigrant background and older workers;
3. basic education should provide young people with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes necessary for further learning, employment and entrepreneurship and prepare students to follow a general education pathway or a VET pathway or a combination of both;
4. young people in VET should acquire skills and competences relevant to labour market requirements and for lifelong learning.
5. the skills and competences of the adult labour force should be promoted by encouraging the recognition of prior learning gained through training and work experience.
Training opportunities should be provided for those in working life, while assessing the possibilities for and the benefits of a balanced sharing of the financial burden.
At the same time, learning opportunities should be available for disadvantaged individuals and groups, especially for the less educated;
6. the diversity of European VET systems is an asset which serves as a basis for mutual learning and inspiring reforms.
At the same time, this diversity makes it important to increase transparency and common understanding on quality issues, and hence mutual trust between VET systems and practices.
The aim should be to promote a European VET area in which qualifications and skills acquired in one country are recognised throughout Europe, thus supporting the mobility of young people and adults.
RECOGNISE that
1. the Copenhagen process has played an essential role in emphasising the importance of VET to political decision makers.
It has contributed to raising the profile of VET as part of the Lisbon strategy.
The process facilitates agreeing common European goals and objectives, discussing national models and initiatives, and exchanging good examples of practice at the European level.
At national level, the process has contributed to strengthening the focus on VET and has inspired national reforms.
STRESS that
1. special actions addressing VET need to be strengthened in the future.
The Copenhagen process should be continued within the framework of the 'Education and Training 2010' work programme.
A focused and holistic approach should be ensured, in which the different initiatives and tools are interlinked and mutually supportive, and in which VET is
developed at all levels as an essential part of lifelong learning with close links to general education.
Emphasis should be placed on engaging social partners and sectoral organisations in all stages of the work, and on feeding national experiences back into the developmental work at European level;
2. measures are voluntary and should be developed through bottom-up cooperation.
AGREE that
The Copenhagen and Maastricht priorities remain valid and should be reinforced in the next phase as follows:
1.
Policy focused on improving the attractiveness and quality of VET
More attention should be paid by Member States to the image, status and attractiveness of VET.
This calls for:
improved guidance throughout life to take better account of the opportunities and requirements of VET and of working life, including increased career guidance, information and advice in schools;
open VET systems which offer access to flexible, individualised pathways and create better conditions for transition to working life, progression to further education and training, including higher education, and which support the skills development of adults in the labour market;
close links with working life, both in initial and continuing vocational education and training, and increased opportunities to learn at the workplace;
promoting the recognition of non-formal and informal learning to support career development and lifelong learning;
measures to increase the interest and participation of men or women in those VET fields in which they remain under-represented, for instance women in the technology field;
developing and highlighting excellence in skills, for instance by applying world-class standards or organising skills competitions[15].
In improving the attractiveness and quality of VET, more emphasis should be placed on good governance of VET systems and providers in delivering the VET agenda[16].
This means:
national quality assurance and improvement in line with the Council Conclusions on Quality Assurance in VET[17];
improving public and private investment in VET through the development of balanced and shared funding and investment mechanisms;
increased transparency of VET systems;
tronger leadership of institutions and/or training providers within national strategies;
highly qualified teachers and trainers who undertake continuous professional development;
active partnership between different decision makers and stakeholders, in particular social partners and sectoral organisations, at national, regional and local levels.
2.
Development and implementation of common tools for VET
The development of common European tools should be continued in order to pave the way towards a European area of VET and to support the competitiveness of the European labour market.
The aim should be for the agreed tools to be in place by 2010.
Further development of:
common European tools specifically aimed at VET, by:
developing and testing a European Credit Transfer System for VET (ECVET) as a tool for credit accumulation and transfer, taking into account the specificities of VET and the experience gained with the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) in higher education;
trengthening cooperation on quality improvement by using the European Network of Quality Assurance for VET (ENQA-VET) to support the creation of a common understanding on quality assurance and to foster mutual trust.
Cooperation with higher education should be continued;
common European tools in which VET plays a major role, by:
developing and testing a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) based on learning outcomes, providing greater parity and better links between the VET and HE sectors and taking account of international sectoral qualifications;
further developing EUROPASS as the single European framework for transparency, and tools for the recognition of non-formal and informal learning, in order to support and complement the introduction of EQF and ECVET.
Implementation of:
common European tools specifically aimed at VET, by:
participating in the testing of ECVET and encouraging its implementation;
drawing on the principles underlying a Common Quality Assurance Framework, as referred to in the May 2004 Council Conclusions on quality assurance in VET, in order to promote a culture of quality improvement and wider participation in the ENQA-VET network;
common European tools in which VET plays a major role, by:
linking national qualification systems or national qualifications frameworks to the EQF;
upporting national qualifications systems in incorporating international sectoral qualifications, using the EQF as a reference point;
promoting widespread use of EUROPASS.
3.
Strengthening mutual learning
A more systematic approach is needed to strengthen mutual learning, cooperative work and the sharing of experience and know-how.
This should be facilitated by:
common concepts and agreed definitions at European level in order to make national solutions, models and standards more easily understood;
Commission funding for research and surveys on specific topics to deepen understanding of European VET systems and practices, and their links to the labour market and other education sectors;
monitoring by the Commission of networks, the exchange of examples of good practice and the development of mechanisms which can be used to disseminate knowledge and expertise;
a systematic and flexible framework to support peer learning activities in the field of VET.
The framework should also support decentralised peer learning.
Adequate and consistent data and indicators are the key to understanding what is happening in VET, to strengthening mutual learning and to laying the foundations for evidence-based training policy.
By the time of the next Ministerial follow-up Conference in 2008 the Commission should have:
given special attention to improving the scope, precision and reliability of VET statistics so that progress in developing VET can be evaluated;
devoted attention to the development of the VET component within the coherent framework of indicators and benchmarks[18];
paid particular attention to the development of statistical information on investment in and the financing of VET.
This would best be achieved by using and combining existing data to the best advantage, while ensuring adequate national/regional data on VET and consistency and comparability with other data on education and training.
4.
Taking all stakeholders on board
The success of the Copenhagen process relies on the active involvement of all stakeholders in the field of VET, including in particular the social partners at European and national level, sectoral organisations and VET providers.
This calls for:
concise and clear information on the process, its background, priorities and activities and the effective transfer of results;
the active participation in all stages of the process of stakeholders at European, national, regional and local level;
emphasis on involving VET providers, teachers and trainers in testing and implementing the outcomes of the process;
the involvement, where appropriate, of learners and their organisations at national and European level.
INVITE THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION, WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMPETENCES,
to implement the Copenhagen process through:
the effective use of structural funds to support VET reforms at national level;
targeted use of the new Lifelong Learning Programme to support the process, particularly for innovation, testing, experimentation and implementation;
the active participation of relevant Community agencies, bodies and committees;
close cooperation on statistics, indicators and benchmarks with EUROSTAT, OECD, CEDEFOP, and ETF;
the exchange of information, expertise and results with third countries, particularly those countries covered by the 'wider Europe neighbourhood' policy.
Cooperation with high-performing countries and international organisations such as OECD should be strengthened.
The right of participation of all Member States in this work should be ensured.
In the annual reporting on the national Lisbon reform programmes special attention should be paid to progress in VET.
The integrated biennial report on the 'Education and Training 2010' work programme should include a specific part addressing VET, enabling monitoring of the progress and identifying key outcomes to be reported to the European Council."
Efficiency and equity in education and training - Council conclusions
The Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States adopted the following conclusions:
"The Council of the European Union and the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council,
HAVING REGARD to:
3. the first and second strategic objectives of the 'Education & Training 2010' work programme, "Improving the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in the EU" - including its associated objective "Making the best use of resources"[21] - and "Facilitating the access to all to education and training systems" - including its associated objectives "Open learning environment" and "Supporting active citizenship, equal opportunities and social cohesion" ;
9. the Commission communication on "Efficiency and equity in European education and training systems"[27] which invites the Member States to develop a culture of evaluation and which, having been prepared in collaboration with research networks, represents a positive step towards the further development of evidence-based policy in education and training.
NOTE that
1. education and training are fields for the relevant authorities in individual Member States to organise and resource in accordance with national legislation, policies and practices.
At the same time, however, there is a need for European cooperation in order to learn from one another's experiences and good practices, and for indicators and benchmarks in order to follow progress.
Successful education and training policies in a lifelong learning context require a cross-sectoral approach in conjunction with other relevant policies, especially those in the fields of research and innovation, employment, economic affairs, social and health care, youth and culture.
STATE that
The challenge for Member States within their lifelong learning strategies is to identify those priorities for education investments that will impact most efficiently on the quality and equity of learning outcomes;
Despite the tight constraints on public spending, there is widespread recognition of the need to ensure adequate – and where appropriate increased - funding for human resources and therefore to consider how to increase and/or make the best use of private contributions;
The development of efficient and equitable high quality education and training systems contributes significantly towards reducing the risks of unemployment, social exclusion and wasted human potential in a modern knowledge-based economy;
The efforts of teaching staff should be supported by continuous professional development and by good cooperation with parents, pupil welfare services and the wider community.
In addition, high quality teaching and learning environments ensure good conditions for learning and contribute to positive learning outcomes;
They produce positive human and socio-economic results that carry over into further education and adulthood.
Whilst respecting the responsibility of the Member States for organising their education and training systems, there is also some research evidence to suggest that, in certain cases, differentiating pupils at too early an age into separate schools of different types on the basis of ability may have negative effects on the achievement of disadvantaged pupils;
Special measures are needed to identify and support pupils with special educational needs.
These measures include ensuring sufficient numbers of specially trained teaching and guidance staff together with a high standard of pupil welfare services and adequate resources.
Although the cross-sectoral co-operation needed for early intervention and other special measures aimed at ensuring equity in education and training inevitably entail additional costs, in the long term they pay dividends by helping to avoid future costs resulting from exclusion;
As the labour market demand for skills rises, it is increasingly important to give the younger generation access to qualifications and skills, thereby improving their prospects for employment and social integration;
The growth in student numbers and cost of high-quality education and research will require increased and/or more effective use of both public and private resources.
High quality higher education also has a key role to play in education and training as a whole, by educating future teaching staff and updating and renewing the whole knowledge base of education;
Ensuring relevant, high quality qualifications for young people and improving the skills and competences of the low-skilled and disadvantaged groups bring substantial economic gains, even in the short term.
Competence-based qualifications frameworks and other mechanisms for recognising prior learning promote efficiency and equity by taking into account non-formal and informal learning outcomes in addition to formal qualifications.
Encouraging partnerships between stakeholders - including the social partners and sectoral organisations - could also enhance the effectiveness and attractiveness of vocational education and training programmes.
In the short term, targeting investments on updating and upgrading existing skills and competences of the labour force is a rapid way of contributing towards economic growth and competitiveness, and of discouraging early retirement of the ageing work force.
Adult learning also has a key role to play in providing new key competences, such as digital literacy, and thus contributing towards greater social inclusion and active participation in community and society, including after retirement;
INVITE THE MEMBER STATES to
1. further consider whether the present arrangements for funding, governing and managing their education and training systems adequately reflect the need to ensure both efficiency and equity, and so make optimum use of resources.
With that in view, they are invited to examine possible ways of improving the present arrangements, in order to avoid the hidden but high costs of educational inequity;
2. ensure the efficient targeting of education and training reforms and investment, both in the long term and the short term, in order to meet the needs of the knowledge-based society through improved quality and equity, particularly by focusing on pre-primary education, targeted early intervention programmes and equitable education and training systems that are aimed at providing opportunities, access, treatment and outcomes which are independent of socio-economic background and other factors which may lead to educational disadvantage.
In addition, the provision of high quality teaching in disadvantaged areas should be particularly encouraged.
3. ensure adequate funding for human resources and, where appropriate, increase public funding and encourage greater complementary private contributions, in order to secure more equitable access to higher education.
The modernisation of the higher education and research sectors is also important to improve their efficiency.
Consideration should also be given to fostering collaborative links with business in areas of research and development;
4. ensure adequate funding of adult education and continuing vocational education and training, and encourage active partnerships with employers in order to focus on the skills needs of the economy, including at regional and local levels;
5. encourage research into the outcomes of education reforms and investments and into the social benefits resulting from them.
Coherent, relevant, reliable, evidence-based information is the basis for accountability as well as for taking the action needed to achieve quality, equity and efficiency throughout the education and training system.
At the same time, monitoring, evaluation and quality assurance should provide objective and transparent feed-back and support for the development of teaching and learning methods and practice;
INVITE THE COMMISSION AND THE MEMBER STATES to
1. work together with the relevant research networks, in order to provide more comprehensive and integrated analyses in support of education and training reforms and, where appropriate, develop internationally comparable indicators on the efficiency and equity of education and training systems;
2. encourage and support research into the social and economic impact of education and training reforms and investments both at national and international level.
There is a need for more research, particularly in sectors that are not currently sufficiently researched - such as pre-primary education, vocational training, lifelong learning and the economics of education, in particular the impact of private contributions;
3. make use of relevant research results and existing data to combine quality, equity and efficiency dimensions in the preparation of both the 'Education & Training 2010' national reports and the 2008 joint interim report, as well as in relation to a possible proposal for common objectives for European education and training systems and their promotion beyond 2010;
4. design and implement peer-learning activities in the field of efficiency and equity in the framework of the 'Education & Training 2010' work programme;
5. make appropriate use of the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Structural Funds and the Seventh Research Framework Programme to support the efficiency and equity aspects of education and training systems."

on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is well known that Uyghuria is in imminent danger of becoming a second Tibet.
The People's Republic of China has announced a 'Kashgar Dangerous House Reform', the purpose of which is to raze 85 per cent of the Old City in Kashgar.
Such philistinism must be stopped and the European Union must insist that the authorities of the People's Republic of China do not destroy this important cultural site on the ancient Silk Road.
The UN Declaration of the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, as well as the constitution of the People's Republic of China, must be respected, even by Beijing.
The People's Republic of China is more and more exercising sinicisation of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and the Tibetans.
It is a cultural genocide in the 21st century, which we simply cannot accept.
Ending the Financial Arms Race
CAMBRIDGE – People often ask if regulators and legislators have fixed the flaws in the financial system that took the world to the brink of a second Great Depression.
The short answer is no.
Yes, the chances of an immediate repeat of the acute financial meltdown of 2008 are much reduced by the fact that most investors, regulators, consumers, and even politicians will remember their financial near-death experience for quite some time.
As a result, it could take a while for recklessness to hit full throttle again.
But, otherwise, little has fundamentally changed.
Legislation and regulation produced in the wake of the crisis have mostly served as a patch to preserve the status quo.
Politicians and regulators have neither the political courage nor the intellectual conviction needed to return to a much clearer and more straightforward system.
In his recent speech to the annual, elite central-banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the Bank of England’s Andy Haldane made a forceful plea for a return to simplicity in banking regulation.
Haldane rightly complained that banking regulation has evolved from a small number of very specific guidelines to mind-numbingly complicated statistical algorithms for measuring risk and capital adequacy.
Legislative complexity is growing exponentially in parallel.
In the United States, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was just 37 pages and helped to produce financial stability for the greater part of seven decades.
The recent Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is 848 pages, and requires regulatory agencies to produce several hundred additional documents giving even more detailed rules.
Combined, the legislation appears on track to run 30,000 pages.
As Haldane notes, even the celebrated “Volcker rule,” intended to build a better wall between more mundane commercial banking and riskier proprietary bank trading, has been hugely watered down as it grinds through the legislative process.
The former Federal Reserve chairman’s simple idea has been co-opted and diluted through hundreds of pages of legalese.
The problem, at least, is simple: As finance has become more complicated, regulators have tried to keep up by adopting ever more complicated rules.
It is an arms race that underfunded government agencies have no chance to win.
Even back in the 1990’s, regulators would privately complain of the difficulty of retaining any staff capable of understanding the rapidly evolving derivatives market.
Research assistants with one year of experience working on derivatives issues would get bid away by the private sector at salaries five times what the government could pay.
Around the same time, in the mid-1990’s, academics began to publish papers suggesting that the only effective way to regulate modern banks was a form of self-regulation.
Let banks design their own risk management systems, audit them to the limited extent possible, and then severely punish them if they produce a loss outside agreed parameters.
Many economists argued that these clever models were flawed, because the punishment threat was not credible, particularly in the case of a systemic meltdown affecting a large part of the financial system.
But the papers were published anyway, and the ideas were implemented.
It is not necessary to recount the consequences.
The clearest and most effective way to simplify regulation has been advanced in a series of important papers by Anat Admati of Stanford (with co-authors including Peter DeMarzo, Martin Hellwig, and Paul Pfleiderer).
Their basic point is that financial firms should be forced to fund themselves in a more balanced fashion, and not to rely so heavily on debt finance.
Admati and her colleagues recommend requirements that force financial firms to generate equity funding either through retained earnings or, in the case of publicly traded firms, through stock issuance.
The status quo allows banks instead to leverage taxpayer assistance by holding razor-thin equity margins, relying on debt to a far greater extent than typical large non-financial firms do.
Some large firms, such as Apple, hold virtually no debt at all.
Greater reliance on equity would give banks a much larger cushion to absorb losses.
The financial industry complains that efforts to force greater equity funding would curtail lending, but this is just nonsense in a general equilibrium setting.
Nevertheless, governments have been very timid in advancing on this front, with the new Basel III rules taking only a baby step toward real change.
Of course, it is not easy to legislate financial reform in a stagnant global economy, for fear of impeding credit and turning a sluggish recovery into a full-blown recession.
And, surely, academics are also to blame for the inertia, with many of them still defending elegant but deeply flawed models of perfect markets that create an illusion of safety for a system that is in fact highly risk-prone.
The fashionable idea of allowing banks to issue “contingent capital” (debt that becomes equity in a systemic crisis) is no more credible than the idea of committing to punish banks severely in the event of a crisis.
A simpler and more transparent system would ultimately lead to more lending and greater stability, not less.
It is high time to restore sanity to financial-market regulation.
(ES) Mr President, I will begin by congratulating Mr Hutchinson on clearly setting out in his report the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2007.
The Assembly is becoming the strongest pillar of cooperation between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
I would like to point out that it is the only international assembly that regularly brings together the elected representatives of various countries in order to promote North-South interdependence.
The JPA has led the way with economic partnership agreements, which are tools for the regional development and integration policy for the ACP countries and a means of progressively including them in the global economy in a sustainable way.
However, economic partnership agreements (EPAs) cannot be negotiated simply as free trade agreements.
My group insists on the possibility of renegotiating issues in these agreements such as services, intellectual property and the 'Singapore issues': investments, powers and public markets, as well as employment and social regulations and other issues relating to sustainable development.
1. 2007 discharge: European Parliament (
Madam President, after my speech at the start of this debate, I actually only have two more comments to make.
The first, which I quite deliberately left to the end of the debate, is that I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs for their friendly and constructive cooperation.
It is quite simply easier to negotiate when you know that your colleagues support you.
For that reason, these were not the most difficult of negotiations.
My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance.
Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this.
I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text. Read the text!
Reading the text will enlighten the mind.
Then you will see that the compromise most definitely does contain statements - and indeed very strict, legally binding statements - on this matter.
Then all of your concerns should, in fact, be dispelled.
Brussels, 16 February 2001
Commission authorises acquisition of E.ON's stake in VIAG Interkom by British Telecom
The Commission's investigation has shown that the deal does not raise any competition concerns given that there is no addition of market shares.
Mr President, if the sitting is supposed to resume at 3 p.m. then would it not be a good idea to start at 3 p.m. and not have lunch until all hours of the afternoon?
However, there are more serious points which we should perhaps draw to your attention.
You will be aware that your employees assaulted two of our employees – that is, employees of the United Kingdom Independence Party – this morning, causing bodily injury.
I would like to ask whether this happened as a result of your instructions and whether or not you are prepared to take responsibility for this?
I appreciate that you are not the President of Parliament, who has always proved partial.
At Westminster, the Speaker's job is to protect the rights of backbenchers.
All that the President of this Parliament – who is totally inexperienced – seems to do is to want to preserve the status quo.
This morning he has really blotted his copy book because, last month, he permitted all the signs saying 'Yes to Turkey' to remain up in this Chamber for a considerable period of time.
He set a precedent then, so why were we not permitted this very day to hold up signs saying 'Say no'?
Trump’s Ancient Ballot Lie
NEW YORK – As the United States heads toward its most significant and contentious presidential election in a very long time, there is much talk about voting by mail.
Some see this option as necessary to ensure ballot access for all amid the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly blue-collar workers and minority groups, who have disproportionately high infection rates.
But others, including President Donald Trump, vociferously oppose mail-in ballots, pointing to a purported risk of fraud.
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year. From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
Their argument is bogus – and not exactly new.
For the last six centuries, those seeking to limit the franchise have sought to achieve their goals by citing the need to maintain the “integrity” of the electoral system.
Consider England in the early fifteenth century.
At that time, each English county sent two “knights of the shire” as representatives to Parliament.
And because there was no formal law governing how these knights (a largely honorific term) would be selected, it fell to each county’s sheriff to organize an election.
By custom, all free male inhabitants of a county had the right to participate, while women were excluded.
Some of these elections were no doubt rowdy and undisciplined – as democracy often is – but they allowed for much greater (male) participation than would soon be the case.
In 1429, members of the House of Commons petitioned King Henry VI to agree to a new law ostensibly intended to ensure that county elections to Parliament proceeded peacefully.
The petition stated that without this new law, “homicides, riots, assaults, and divisions will most probably arise and occur.” In other words, the law’s backers claimed, the integrity of the electoral process was in danger.
But the parliamentarians’ proposed method of addressing the perceived problem betrayed their true motivation.
They called for the county election franchise to be restricted to those who owned land with an annual return of at least 40 shillings, a significant sum at the time.
Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more – All for less than $9 a month.
The root cause of the problem, as the law’s supporters saw it, was “the too great and excessive numbers of people” who had been participating in elections. The 40-shilling rule became law in England in 1430, and would not be repealed until Parliament passed the Great Reform Act of 1832.
With that act, Parliament had finally come around to the idea that the 40-shilling rule was an anachronism.
But then a new twist to the story brought about a feature of voting that we view as sacred today.
Some members of Parliament advocated not only expanding the franchise, but also making the ballot for elections to the House of Commons secret.
Since time immemorial, voting in county elections had taken place in public, enabling people with means to intimidate or bribe others to vote as instructed.
But it would be another 40 years before Parliament finally adopted the 1872 Ballot Act.
One of the main reasons for the delay in introducing secret balloting was that opponents argued – once again – that it would jeopardize the integrity of the electoral process.
Some MPs had proposed a secret ballot as early as 1830, but others argued then that such a measure would result in “eternal suspicion and hypocrisy.” In 1862, another opponent of secret ballots said much the same thing, claiming that, “instead of being a check on bribery, it would facilitate it by preventing detection in many cases.”
Sadly, such arguments are being echoed today in the US, which has entered a new era of voting restrictions that recalls its past disenfranchisement of African-Americans.
In recent years, 25 US states have passed laws that make it more difficult to vote, such as by requiring a photo ID or even proof of citizenship.
States have also limited turnout by reducing the number of polling stations.
The clear effect of these measures is to tilt the playing field against low-income and minority groups.
Much like in England 600 years ago, the stated objective – preserving the integrity of the electoral process – is just a convenient smokescreen.
In the US debate over voting by mail – a measure supported by a large majority of American adults – opponents of broad electoral participation are once again raising the specter of fraud and corruption to pursue narrow partisan goals.
Without citing any evidence, they claim that this new voting system is somehow subject to greater irregularities than traditional in-person voting.
But the real fear of Trump and others is that mail-in voting will boost turnout and aid Democratic candidates, even though it is not even certain that such an effect exists in states that already allow it.
We can only hope that the advocates of expanded suffrage will eventually resume their winning streak.
Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Ceuta affair has come and gone, the Melilla affair has come and gone and now it is the suburbs that are on fire.
The worldwide media is asking questions and, as for us, what are we doing?
Drafting a legislative programme.
To deal with what?
Global warming, for example, which seems logical; when cars and schools are on fire, there is indeed a problem in terms of global warming and, therefore, in terms of respecting the Kyoto protocol.
Alongside Mrs Fischer-Boel, we could, moreover, do slightly more to destroy our agriculture, such as it is; Mr Mandelson would obtain an agreement in Hong Kong and, for our part, we would have slightly higher levels of unemployment.
Let us adopt a few more directives, and the mountain of legislation will end up rendering us quite powerless.
I would even go so far as to propose a title for Mr Barroso’s legislative programme: ‘Operation smoke and mirrors’, for the programme is a smoke screen, concealing nice ideas, but ones that only mask tragedies.
One final word, Mr Barroso: one Christmas day in the fifth century A.D., the Rhine froze over following a climate change.
Thousands of chariots of fire crossed the Rhine, and Rome was plundered.
Do you know what the Roman Senate was doing during that winter of 483?
It was drafting a legislative programme.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transparency initiative is probably the greatest success achieved by the Barroso Commission.
I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for your words and for the fact that you want harmonisation of the publication of information on beneficiaries of subsidies.
This was a major point of discussion between Parliament and the Commission last year.
As you know, this House and the PPE-DE Group have always stood by you on the issue of transparency because we want to know whether we are meeting our political objectives via the beneficiaries of the subsidies, in other words, the recipients of the funding.
This is about meeting our political objectives, nothing else, and we need to know more than we do at present.
Commissioner, you are working on new ethical rules.
We believe that the institutions need these rules and the Commissioners themselves need a new code of conduct.
However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, may I remind you that it is not up to the Commission to lay down rules for Parliament.
We make our rules ourselves.
We are not public officials, unlike the members of other EU institutions, although imprecise use of language could create this impression.
We have an amendment to paragraph 22, and I would like to ask you very warmly for your support.
We want to replace the list with a reference to the existing rules.
Lists are all very well, but we want an open form of words which allows us to decide whether we want so many, or perhaps more - or, indeed, fewer - criteria.
We are not satisfied - and this is part of the report - with the difficult question of the recovery of funds which have been paid out incorrectly.
Commissioner, I think this is going to be the major issue for us this year and the main point of conflict between Parliament and the Commission.
This is an area which is anything but transparent.
I would ask you to tackle this problem vigorously.
Recoveries cannot continue in the same random fashion as in the past.
We welcome this week's action plan for the Structural Funds, but this needs to be underpinned with credibility, both for Parliament and for the discharge of the Commission.
Our rapporteur, Javier Pomés Ruiz, has drafted a good and interesting report, and I am sure that with this report as the opinion of Parliament, we will help the Commission to make further progress.
I voted in favour of this resolution as I condemn the violence against women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
There is an urgent need to step up the fight against impunity and to put an immediate end to the violence and human rights violations in that country.
A Development Investment for the Ages
PRAGUE – Malnutrition receives less attention than most of the world’s other major challenges.
Yet it is one area where a relatively small investment can have the most powerful impact.
An estimated two billion people do not receive the essential vitamins and minerals they need to grow and thrive – notably, iron, iodine, vitamin A, and zinc.
Worse, malnutrition and undernutrition are part of a cruel cycle, in that they are both causes and effects of poverty.
This cycle disproportionately affects infants and young children, who suffer devastating consequences from malnutrition, including mental impairment, difficulty learning in school, and poor health generally.
Even moderate nutritional deficiencies can hinder a child’s development.
And because it is harder for that child to get a good job when he or she grows up, malnutrition shapes not just his or her life, but also the lives of the next generation.
Ideally, nutrients should come from a balanced, varied diet.
But because this is not always possible, particularly in poor countries, governments and development organizations have a responsibility to help.
For more than a decade, my think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus, has studied and compared development options for governments and donor organizations operating at a global, regional, and national level.
We work with the world’s top specialist economists, including Nobel laureates, to determine the best ways to fight humanity’s biggest challenges.
During this time, we have shined a spotlight on a wide range of important causes.
For example, in 2004, our research made the case for stepping up the fight against HIV/AIDS, which then became a priority of the Danish government.
And last year, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos declared that our research into biodiversity was the reason for quadrupling the size of a marine reserve off his country’s coast.
Still, investments designed to fight “hidden hunger” or micronutrient deficiencies have consistently ranked near the top of our priority lists.
The evidence clearly shows that breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty and undernutrition is one of the most powerful ways to improve lives anywhere on the planet.
In both 2008 and 2012, Copenhagen Consensus projects focusing on global development priorities concluded that policymakers and philanthropists should make fighting malnourishment a top priority.
In each of these projects, experts wrote dozens of research papers examining how best to spend resources on a variety of issues, from armed conflict and biodiversity destruction to infectious disease and sanitation.
Even with dozens of compelling investments to choose from, Nobel laureate economists poring over the data found that measures to combat malnutrition were among the most powerful options.
The 2012 study demonstrated that an investment of just $100 per child could pay for a bundle of interventions – including micronutrients, diet-quality improvements, and behavior-change programs – that would reduce chronic undernutrition in developing countries by 36%.
In other words, each dollar spent reducing chronic undernutrition – even in very poor countries – would create returns to society worth $30.
The 2012 study had a tangible impact.
The following year, a coalition of non-governmental organizations pledged more than $750 million for nutrition programs, based partly on our findings.
Similarly, former British Prime Minister David Cameron cited the same research at a 2013 meeting on “Nutrition for Growth,” when G8 governments committed to spending $4.15 billion more on the fight against malnutrition.
What’s true at a global level is also true for many countries.
The two most recent Copenhagen Consensus projects focused on Bangladesh and Haiti.
In Bangladesh, 30,000 children die every year due to malnourishment.
We called for more investments in targeted interventions that reach children in their first 1,000 days; and in a promising development, our research factored into Bangladesh’s Second National Plan of Action for Nutrition.
In Haiti, the government, with support from USAID, has just launched the country’s first food-fortification project.
Fortification helps many people at once, because it involves adding nutrients to foods that are widely consumed – such as staples (wheat, rice, oils) or condiments (salt, soy sauce, sugar).
It is just one weapon in the fight against malnutrition – the arsenal also includes education and targeted initiatives such as providing supplements to mothers and newborns – but a very important one.
Fortification isn’t a new idea.
Most people living in rich countries benefit from it whether they realize it or not.
In the early twentieth century, salt iodization began in Switzerland and has since been implemented across the world.
Vitamin A-fortified margarine was first introduced in Denmark in 1918.
And in the 1930s, vitamin A-fortified milk and flour enriched with iron and B vitamins were introduced in a number of developed countries.
At this point, fortification is almost universal in the developed world, yet it is still absent in many low- and middle-income countries.
Haiti’s fortification project will focus on enriching wheat flour with iron and folic acid, vegetable oils with vitamin A, and salt with iodine.
After we presented our findings to Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, he took steps to require that all wheat be fortified with vital micronutrients within one year.
And during the launch of the new program, one US official cited Copenhagen Consensus research to show that fortification is “one of the most efficient investments in Haiti’s development.”
A research paper by Stephen Vosti of the University of California, Davis, and colleagues shows that 95% of Haiti’s wheat flour could be fortified for a decade with an investment of just $5.1 million in premixed micronutrients, equipment, and training.
This relatively small investment would deliver extraordinary benefits, not least by preventing 140 neural-tube-defect deaths and more than 250,000 cases of anemia every year.
In monetary terms, each dollar spent would accrue benefits to Haitian society worth $24.
There is no panacea for all of today’s development challenges.
But policies to improve nutrition come closer than most.
They have the potential to end a cruel cycle of poverty and malnourishment that can last for generations.
Euro 2012: Commission supports security at football stadiums
It is the first time that mobile detection equipment for explosives, chemical and biological threats have been deployed in the EU during such a high profile public event.
With all eyes focusing on the ball, security at stadiums becomes all the more essential.
The Euro 2012 must be a celebration where everybody can feel safe, " said Cecilia Malmström, Commissioner for Home Affairs.
Football fans can be scanned at the entrance of the stadium where usual security and ticket checks are carried out.
The Commission is expected to launch more practical trials of detection equipment in other areas of public security during the autumn of 2012 and the spring of 2013.
Background
It focuses not only on the traditional areas of detection, such as airport or transportation hubs, but also on security of public events.

Mr President, as parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the democratic will of the citizens we represent in keeping with the laws and the constitutions of our sovereign Member States.
We must also ensure that in the European Union human dignity is protected and the weakest and most vulnerable are defended.
It is unacceptable for human life, whatever its age, to be treated as a commercial product, without regard to that life or the price paid by women in supplying the embryos.
It is deeply disturbing that the European Commission, supported by Members of this Parliament and certain Member State governments, is seeking to impose public funding of controversial and unethical research without proper public debate and without the opportunity for national parliaments to respond.
There has certainly been no debate in Dáil Éireann.
This proposal is against not only laws and constitutions, but also the conscience of millions of citizens.
It also pressures applicant and Third World countries to become part of an EU market-place for human embryo research.
This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and, as our rapporteur has pointed out, is high-risk.
Let us not play on the hopes and fears of sufferers.
Let us use public funding for adult stem cell research, which has positive scientific results and may be as effective as research using embryonic stem cells.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rejected the Commission's proposal and I urge support for the amendments tabled by its chairman, Mr Gargani, which I have co-signed with other Members.
Last week a key committee in the Irish Parliament also voted to reject this unethical research.
There is a public outcry in Ireland.
Tánaiste Mary Harney and the Irish Government have no mandate to agree this funding on behalf of Irish citizens.
Just as there was no public mandate for an EU Constitution, there was clearly no mandate for this unconstitutional and unethical use of taxpayers' money.
Obama Joins the Greek Chorus
PRINCETON – US President Barack Obama’s recent call to ease the austerity imposed on Greece is remarkable – and not only for his endorsement of the newly elected Greek government’s negotiating position in the face of its official creditors.
Obama’s comments represent a break with the long-standing tradition of official American silence on European monetary affairs.
While scholars in the United States have frequently denounced the policies of Europe’s monetary union, their government has looked the other way.
Those who criticize the euro or how it is managed have long run the risk of being dismissed as Anglo-Saxons or, worse, anti-Europeans.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher accurately foresaw the folly of a European monetary union.
Gordon Brown, as British Chancellor of the Exchequer, followed in Thatcher’s footsteps.
When his staff presented carefully researched reasons for not joining the euro, many Europeans sneered.
And that is why Obama’s statement was such a breath of fresh air.
It came a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Greece should not expect more debt relief and must maintain austerity.
Meanwhile, after days of not-so-veiled threats, the European Central Bank is on the verge of cutting funding to Greek banks.
The guardians of financial stability are amplifying a destabilizing bank run.
Obama’s breach of Europe’s intellectual insularity is all the more remarkable because even the International Monetary Fund has acquiesced in German-imposed orthodoxy.
As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the Irish Times: “A debt is a debt, and it is a contract.
Defaulting, restructuring, changing the terms has consequences.”
The Fund stood by in the 1990s, when the eurozone misadventure was concocted.
In 2002, the director of the IMF’s European Department described the fiscal rules that institutionalized the culture of persistent austerity as a “sound framework.”
And, in May 2010, the IMF endorsed the European authorities’ decision not to impose losses on Greece’s private creditors – a move that was reversed only after unprecedented fiscal belt-tightening sent the Greek economy into a tailspin.
The delays and errors in managing the Greek crisis started early.
In July 2010, Lagarde, who was France’s finance minister at the time, recognized the damage incurred by those initial delays, “If we had been able to address [Greece’s debt] right from the start, say in February, I think we would have been able to prevent it from snowballing the way that it did.” Even the IMF acknowledged that it had been a mistake not to impose losses on private creditors preemptively; it finally did so only in June 2013, when the damage had already been done.
There is plenty of blame to go around.
Former US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner championed a hardline stance against debt restructuring during a crisis.
As a result, despite warnings by several IMF Directors in May 2010 that restructuring was inevitable, the US supported the European position that private creditors needed to be paid in full.
Lee Buchheit, a leading sovereign-debt attorney and the man who managed the eventual Greek debt restructuring in 2012, was harshly critical of the authorities’ failure to face up to reality.
As he put it, “I find it hard to imagine they will now man up to the proposition that they delayed – at appalling cost to Greece, its creditors, and its official-sector sponsors – an essential debt restructuring.”
Obama may have arrived late to the right conclusion, but he expressed what should be an obvious truth: “You cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression.”
If Obama’s words are to count, he must continue to push for the kind of deal Greece needs – one that errs on the side of too much debt forgiveness, rather than too little.
Recent analysis shows that forgiveness of Greece’s official debt is unambiguously desirable, as another bogus deal will keep the Greek economy depressed, ensuring that the problem soon recurs.
If European sensitivities must be assuaged, Greece’s debt repayment could be drawn out over 100 years.
At the end of the day, debt forgiveness benefits creditors as much as it helps debtors.
Creditors have known this since at least the sixteenth century, when Spain’s King Philip II became the world’s first known serial sovereign defaulter.
As Jesus put it, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
European authorities must come to understand that the next act of the Greek tragedy will not be confined to Greece.
If relief fails to materialize, political discontent will spread, extremist forces will gain strength, and the survival of the European Union itself could be endangered.
Brussels, 30th April 2003
Commissioner for External Relations, Christopher Patten, has appointed as Chief Observer of the EOM, MEP Colette Flesch, member of the EP Committee on Development and Co-operation.
The deployment of the EOM follows an invitation from the Rwandan National Electoral Commission.
The EOM is an expression of the EU's efforts to support democratisation in Rwanda and is funded by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).
The cost of the EOM for the constitutional referendum is € 379.684.
The EOM started today with the arrival of the Chief Observer and a Core Team of five election experts in Kigali.
The EOM will assess the entire referendum process, including the legal and political framework, the campaign, the voting and counting, as well as the immediate post-referendum period, with a view to the preparation of the presidential and legislative elections.
The EOM will issue a preliminary statement shortly after polling day and later a final report assessing the entire referendum process and containing recommendations to improve the electoral framework.

This report sets the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination for foodstuffs and animal feed following a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency.
I agree that the European Parliament must play a crucial role in situations having a direct impact on the general public's health.
I also believe that, in the wake of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency, the European Commission must play a supervisory role, declaring a state of emergency and adopting lists of basic foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.
Member States must maintain an official control system for these products and inform the general public about any risks.
I voted for this report, which guarantees the safety of European citizens' food in the event of nuclear accidents or radiological emergencies.
A high level of protection of human health is one of the objectives that the European Union must achieve as it defines its policy.
EU regulations laying down levels of radioactive contamination in case of radiological emergency remain unchanged since 1990, and therefore it is necessary to review and update these provisions.
We must set up a comprehensive system allowing the Union, following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to a significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, to fix maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in order to ensure a high level of protection of public health.
I agree that the permitted levels of radioactive contamination must be reviewed at regular intervals in order to take into account the latest international scientific progress and scientific recommendations and to avoid existing divergences in regulatory practice.
I voted in favour of this report which proposes to stipulate the procedure for determining the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs which may be placed on the market following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to, or has led to, significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.
At the same time, Annexes I and III set out the maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.
Although this proposal is dealt with through the recasting technique, I believe that we must substantially amend the proposal beyond the sole grey part identified, so as to ensure the legal certainty and coherence of the text.
It is necessary to streamline the procedure in cases of nuclear emergency by clearly giving a supervisory role to the Commission and clarifying the regime of its acts (adoption, revision).
Furthermore, we must attempt to serve the interests of the citizens through better management of the post-accident situation.
We must ensure legal certainty of the whole proposal through the alignment of obsolete procedures - 'comitology' procedures in the field of Euratom adopted by analogy - which this proposal intends to codify, with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Bearing in mind that the three regulations on radiation amended by the report in question were adopted in the wake of Chernobyl about 20 years ago, I consider that the Belet report, as it now stands after the vote, is a first attempt to improve the approach to and update the problem of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and the soil.
Although I am in favour of the change to the legal basis and of strengthening the role of the European Parliament, in order to achieve greater transparency in legislation and broader protection for citizens, I consider the report to be inadequate and several steps behind what would be a substantive approach to the problem.
It amends what has already been agreed and simply regulates the consequences, rather than the source, of the problem.
Furthermore, it has left the maximum limits for radioactive contamination extremely high and, as a result, it is far removed from the objective of protecting public health.
It is for the above reasons that I abstained in the final vote.
I believe that EU Member States are responsible for monitoring compliance with the levels laid down for protection against radioactive contamination in this regulation, in particular, through the surveillance of the safety standards of both foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, as well as through monitoring environmental parameters.
I support the idea of creating a system which will allow the EU to set the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination to ensure a high level of protection for the general public's health, following a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency.
Mr Francisco Fonseca Morillo has been appointed the new Head of the Commission's Representation in Madrid.
Currently he is Deputy Director-General in the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers.
Mr Fonseca Morillo joined the Commission in 1986 and since then he has occupied several different positions.
Between 2009 and 2015 he was the Head of the European Commission Representation in Spain, where he developed excellent relations with the national authorities and stakeholders.
Since 2015 he has been working in the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, first as Director and later as Deputy Director-General.
Before joining the European Commission, Mr Fonseca Morillo was a tenured professor of Public International Law.
He obtained his PhD in Law at the University of Valladolid in 1984, after having graduated in Political Sciences in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1979 and in Law at the University of Valladolid in 1977.
Background
The Commission has Representations in all EU Member States as well as Regional Offices in Barcelona, Belfast, Bonn, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Marseille, Milan, Munich and Wroclaw.
The Representations are the Commission's eyes, ears and voice on the ground in all EU Member States.
They interact with national authorities and stakeholders and inform the media and the public about EU policies.
The Representations report to the Commission's headquarters on significant developments in the Member States.
Since the beginning of the Juncker Commission, Heads of Representations are appointed by the President and are his political representatives in the Member State to which they are posted.

I voted in favour of this report as it presents a set of measures that make a significant contribution to universal access to less-favoured or remote areas, such as rural areas or islands.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, and the members of the Agriculture Committee, for an excellent report on the Commission proposal on information and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal and external markets.
I would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report.
I think we all agree that the promotion of European agricultural products is of huge importance, both internally and externally.
I am convinced that trade in agricultural products will continue to grow in the future - even if we have to admit that we face a setback at the present time owing to the economic crisis.
However, there will be huge opportunities for our European products in third-country markets, and our promotion campaign should help European producers explore those new markets.
Before going into the content of the report, I would like to put it into perspective.
In 2008, the Commission adopted 42 programmes on the internal market and on third countries, representing a budget of EUR 128 million over three years.
According to the rules, half of that amount was then to be financed by the Community.
The aim of the Commission proposal is to make it possible for Member States to launch programmes cofinanced by the European Union in third countries - as described by the rapporteur - because today this possibility only exists for the internal market.
It should also be possible for those programmes to be implemented by international organisations.
The three most important amendments from the rapporteur and his colleagues are as follows: firstly, to make it compulsory for Member States to consult trade associations about the proposed programmes; secondly, to specify that implementation by international organisations is not only a possibility reserved for the International Olive Oil Council, but a general possibility, for example - as mentioned here today - also in the wine sector; and, on the budget side, to increase the cofinancing rate.
With regard to those amendments, I would emphasise that Member States do, in fact, already consult trade associations in order to make sure that they have the support of producers.
I would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis.
My mentioning of the International Olive Oil Council is only meant as an example, because of the discussions that have recently taken place on the whole olive oil sector.
It certainly does not exclude other international organisations, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.
Regarding the funding of the budget, there is, of course, ongoing discussion on the level of cofinancing by the Community, but we discussed this issue when merging the two regulations dealing with promotion and information in 2008, so I do not think we should re-open the discussion on this issue.
Could I just take the opportunity to say that, when we agreed the wine reform, we did recognise the importance of promoting our products on third-country markets.
Therefore, in the interests of spending the budget for wine in a smarter and more intelligent way, we proposed the earmarking of EUR 120 million each year for the promotion of our wine products on third country markets as a special budget line.
However, since Member States - and especially the new Member States - did not want to be in a position where that money was earmarked in such a way that, if it was not spent, then it was lost, we included the EUR 120 million in the national envelopes, so that Member States can decide for themselves.
In any case, this gives a clear signal that the Community does care and does recognise the importance of strong promotion of our European products.
I look forward to the discussion here today.
Mr President, I want to speak in favour of Mr Schultz's proposal because this issue is much broader than Lampedusa alone: there are 5 000 kilometres between Morocco and Syria, and with each kilometre, the humanitarian risk grows larger.
It is not a question of knowing if the European Union will help the Italian Government but to know if we are ready to act as a continent to face a continental risk.
This is the task that we face.
The Committee of the Regions will also focus on the role of local and regional authorities in developing and implementing a Community land-use policy which ensures that the social and economic cohesion of Europe's regions is reinforced at the same time.

Mr President, our budget rapporteurs have presented us with a practical budget which addresses the Union’s political and social realities.
To a large extent, our group’s recommended priorities for 2006 have been incorporated.
They include: creating an effective information strategy; providing an efficient service for Members and visitors; continuing to purchase property and buildings under the right conditions; streamlining manpower policy and improving activity-based budgeting, which focuses more on core operations; critically examining all forms of expenditure; making better use of our resources, thus reducing waste, and other inherent malpractices – so adding real value to our performance.
The successful conclusion of a very well structured budget becomes even more relevant considering the potential outcome of the 2007 to 2013 financial perspectives.
In the budget conciliation process Parliament’s negotiating team went a long way to find a workable, balanced formula.
Likewise, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives, but, as Mrs Jensen said, not at any cost.
We should not agree on a set of financial perspectives that would make it very difficult, if not impossible, realistically to deliver on our promises and to meet our commitments and objectives.
We cannot, and should not, pay lip service to high-flown ideas such as growth, employment, research, social solidarity and enlargement and, at the same time, not provide the funds to achieve them.
If we fail our citizens in this respect, apathy and their perception of the barrier between the EU institutions and ordinary citizens will grow much bigger.
In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is.
2. Draft general budget 2008 as modified by the Council (all sections) (vote)
- Report: Kyösti Virrankoski, Ville Itälä
– Mr President, Minister, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on her report.
The European arrest warrant on its own is not an adequate tool for the creation of a European area of security, freedom and justice, nor will we achieve its proper application unless we substantially strengthen mutual trust between judges, unless we apply minimum common rules to criminal proceedings which safeguard suspects' fundamental rights and unless we achieve a rudimentary approximation of national laws.
That is why we are also calling, as a first step, for the approval of the framework decision, with the European Parliament's amendments, on certain procedural rights within the framework of criminal proceedings in the European Union.
We also hope that the future human rights service will take on a substantial role in the protection of and respect for human rights and personal freedoms and in the field of the European arrest warrant.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
Mrs Jeggle is a sensitive, capable and excellent Member of the European Parliament.
The great Indian leader, Ghandi, said that when man treats animals well he demonstrates his humanity and his higher feelings.
As such, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, without any doubts.
However, I would like to highlight a delicate and important point which has to do with livestock farming, which has to do with man.
I do not refer to domestic animals, to cockfights or to dogfights, on which I agree with the rapporteur; I refer to reared animals.
If the measures in the report, which - I repeat - I endorse and support, are applied, then our livestock farmers will have higher production costs, meaning that either we shall have to support them financially or we shall have to find ways of controlling the living conditions of animals reared in third countries whose meat is imported into the European Union.
Otherwise, we shall achieve nothing.
European livestock farming will shrink due to unfair competition and we shall demonstrate that we are hypocrites rather than animal lovers and that we have no sense of proper solidarity with livestock farmers.
Apart from that, I should like to highlight another issue.
I should like stricter controls on wild animal hunting.
Many of our mountains and forests no longer have any wild animals because there is uncontrolled, predatory murder of the animals and this does not only have to do with the animals.
It disrupts the entire ecosystem in the mountains and forests of Europe and the rest of the world.
Mr President, last night was the first anniversary of the death of a great man and a great European, Pope John Paul II.
I am grateful for the opportunity to pay tribute to a man who was and will remain a symbol of interfaith dialogue: between Christianity and Judaism, between Christianity and Islam.
John Paul II is also a symbol of tolerance and respect for all people, irrespective of race, nationality, gender, social class or financial status.
A Pope who came from Central and Eastern Europe, he repeatedly stressed the unity of Europe, even during the times of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.
In Santiago de Compostela in Spain, some 20 years ago, he spoke of Europe as representing unity in diversity.
It is my hope that those words have remained relevant to this day.
Mr President, I wanted to support Mr Albertini.
I think we could vote his oral amendment as an addition to the paragraph we voted on because it would be positive if this House were to condemn what is happening in Bahrain, especially the death sentences.
(Applause)
– Mr President, the Commissioner has already mentioned one of the problems.
We are discussing how seriously new Member States are taking their commitments, but what we are not really discussing is how, specifically, a Member State that has been meeting the criteria for some time but obviously does not wish to join the eurozone, namely Sweden, sees its future.
The question is whether the case of Sweden could potentially set a bad example to others, who are now new Member States.
The Commissioner named a new Member State that has not yet announced a date.
If sanctions are not imposed, will this not set a negative precedent?
Today, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker welcomed the signing of an agreement on the Gas Interconnector Poland – Lithuania, the first pipeline connecting Poland and Lithuania.
"You have witnessed history being made."
Prime Minister of Poland, Ewa Kopacz and President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaité signed the agreement in Brussels today, witnessed by President Juncker and the Prime Minister of Latvia, Laimdota Straujuma and the Prime Minister of Estonia, Taavi Rõivas.
By joining forces and showing solidarity, the participating Member States have made the region more resilient to potential shortages.
The Commission has committed itself to creating links that allow energy to flow where it is most needed.
Every Member State should have access to at least three sources for energy.

We note what Mrs Lulling has said, and I am sure that the statements made in this House will be clarified.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 March 2008.
Today, the European Parliament and the Council came to a provisional agreement on the Commission's proposal for a European Accessibility Act, which will make many everyday products and services accessible to persons with disabilities.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, welcomed the agreement with the following statement:
"Today we have made another important step towards a fairer and more social Europe.
Following today's provisional agreement, the European Union is set to become a more accessible place to live and work for persons with disabilities.
Concretely, we have agreed on the establishment of common accessibility requirements for key products and services such as phones, computers, payment terminals or self-service terminals, banking services, electronic communications including the 112 emergency number, access to audio-visual media services, e-books, e-commerce and some elements of transport services.
The European Accessibility Act establishes the world's largest market for accessible products and services.
This will have a positive impact on the lives of more than 80 million Europeans with disabilities.
It will also make it easier and more attractive for businesses to sell accessible products and services in the European Union and abroad.
By agreeing on the European Accessibility Act, the European Union is showing its firm commitment to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
I hope this agreement will be confirmed quickly, so that we can make a real difference in the lives of millions of European citizens."
Next steps
The agreement will be submitted to the Council's Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper) for approval.
Once the Member States' Permanent Representatives confirm the agreement, the European Parliament will vote in the plenary session and the Council will conclude by the final adoption.
Background
More than 80 million people in the EU are affected by a disability to some degree.
Accessibility is a precondition for their equal participation and active role in society.
It also contributes to ensure smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
The European Accessibility Act was proposed by the European Commission in December 2015 in order to bring benefits both for persons with disabilities and for businesses producing relevant products and services.
Persons with disabilities, as well as many elderly people, will benefit from a greater supply of accessible products and services, and will thus be able to participate more actively in society.
Manufacturers and service providers will be able to sell and export their products and services across the EU without the need to adjust them to divergent national provisions.
Imported products and services will also have to comply with these obligations and requirements.
Keyboards will provide tactual clues.
ATMs will also have visual alerts (blinking lights) in addition to audible signals to indicate where the cards need to be introduced or where the money comes out.
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) contains accessibility obligations, and was ratified by the EU in 2011.
It requires that its Parties, like the EU and the Member States, take the necessary measures, including legislation to ensure accessibility.
Without EU action, each EU country would continue to develop different laws as they implement their obligations, thus causing fragmentation within the EU market.
EU action in this field prevents such fragmentation and creates more market opportunities for businesses.
It broadens the choice and reduces the cost of accessible products and services for consumers and has a potentially positive impact on public budgets on the long-term, by reducing the dependency of older and disabled persons.

Brussels, 7 September 2010
At the moment, different national contract laws lead to higher transaction costs for businesses.
Companies – particularly small businesses – cannot exploit economies of scale in the EU’s Single Market.
Progress towards a European contract law could help resolve these problems.
It wants to ensure that proposals being drafted by a group of contract law experts (IP/10/595 ) meet the needs of both consumers and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
"The European Commission wants to help consumers and businesses get the most out of the Single Market.
That’s why their views are crucial if we want to find real solutions to their problems regarding contractual relations.
Small businesses often lose out because high transaction costs prevent them from expanding into new markets.
“The contribution by consumer and business groups, notably SMEs, is of crucial importance to the Commission.
We want to ensure that the expectations of consumers, enterprises and legal practitioners are met.
Today's meeting shows that we will be listening to European consumers and businesses during every step towards future European contract law solutions. "
A group of legal experts has been meeting since May to prepare a possible European contract law.
Key stakeholders from across Europe who will be closely associated with this group's work met today for the first time.
Among those present:
BusinessEurope, EuroCommerce, Eurochambres, the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises or UEAPME and the International Chamber of Commerce;
BEUC, the European Consumers' Organisation;
lawyers' associations such as the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe and the Council of the Notariats of the European Union.
The group will meet on a monthly basis to follow the expert group’s work and ensure that it takes into account businesses’ practical problems in cross-border trade and consumers’ interests.
Background
Divergences between national contract laws impede the Single Market.
Businesses that want to expand to other EU Member States face high transaction costs.
In addition, consumers’ choices are limited and prices remain high.
As a result, the EU is not reaping the full potential of online commerce.
The group, composed of legal experts from all over Europe, is currently meeting once a month in Brussels.

The Community had to keep forging ahead on its own account.
Nearly all Member States now realized that.
Mr. MARIN said today : "
The financial and economic situation of Third World countries is extremely worrying.
Developed countries, and the European Community in particular, must take immediate action to encourage developing States to pursue their efforts to undertake reform and revive economic and social development.
Nor does the proposal concern measures to relieve bilateral debt, which fall within the competence of the Member States.
It is basically a retroactive adjustment of the terms of aid on the lines of what most Member States have already done at bilateral level.
It also respects the fundamental principles of international debt strategy (case by case approach and appropriate economic conditionality).
Throughout the Lomé IV negotiations the ACP States insisted on the need for a Community response to their problems of external indebtedness.
This was followed by calls from the ACPoEEC Joint Assembly and the European Parliament for specific steps to be taken to cancel the ACP countries' debt with the Community. * * *
.The ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme is nothing other than a propaganda tool designed to benefit the European Union.
This report notes that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in France and the Netherlands and that Europeans are sceptical about enlargement, meaning enlargement to include Turkey.
Yet, far from drawing conclusions from this scathing disapproval, this report seeks to ‘re-educate’ the citizens!
An initiative such as town twinning, which has been proving its worth for a long time now, is shamelessly hijacked, while millions of euros will be poured into communication circles and communication actions.
One amendment, Amendment 14, even encourages actions at Community level!
Referring to actions in the field of sport, the report points out, and I quote, ‘In this way, passive or even euro-sceptical citizens can be reached’.
You actually intend to hunt down those Europeans who, unlike you, are not deluding themselves.
The made-up expression “active” European values’, as promoted by this report, has no meaning whatsoever. A value is neither active nor passive, it is not a device that we can switch on and off, unless we do what you do, and behave like ideologues.
Madam President, you would want to raise the flag and a glass of champagne because, when a populace is able to vote through its own independence, that is only right and proper.
The unpleasant thing here is that South Sudan is actually inheriting a legacy from the past and that the raising of the flag or of a glass of champagne is possibly somewhat out of place, given the situation in which the South Sudanese find themselves.
Now that Abyei has been incorporated into the North, the South Sudanese should be praised for taking a stance of refusing to be provoked.
However, the question, of course, is how long that will last.
The fact that we, the international community, looked on as the issue of Abyei was left unresolved in the referendum is actually highly irresponsible and a recipe for war to start up again in future.
The fact that UN troops will have to be sent again to re-establish peace is also something that we can safely assume.
What I find particularly difficult is the issue of what do we talk about and what do we not?
Let us consider the fact that Sudan is trying to influence the forthcoming referendum in Abyei by insisting that those herdsmen who spend part of their time there and part away from there are included in the count.
Is it justified for South Sudan to argue that, no, they should not be counted, as they are not permanent residents?
If that is the view you take, are you not then denying the herdsmen's right to exist?
It is a Catch 22 situation for which no answer can just be plucked from the air.
There are two other factors to mention, too.
Is South Sudan to be given a fair start?
If so, the South Sudanese are surely, in fact, entitled to debt cancellation?
The debts in question were run up by the regime in Khartoum, and no one can say that these debts served the people of the South well.
The other factor is how are we to deal with the riches beneath the ground in South Sudan?
While we are at it, is South Sudan covered by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which audits freedom from corruption and examines which oil assets benefit the population?
If not, how can we in Europe help?
The one thing, after all, that really helps when it comes to European help for South Sudan - and, in fact, for the North - is actually trade and getting fair investments off the ground.
We are all watching developments anxiously and I hope that we will once again be able to toast the liberty of South Sudan with the flag and a glass of champagne.
2. Situation in Gaza (vote)
- before the vote on paragraph 4:
Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe I have had numerous opportunities to participate in the monitoring of elections in many of the Member States of the Council of Europe, including the elections in Belarus three years ago as well as those which took place in the country last week, and I am therefore in a position to make comparisons.
In this context, I agree with several of the critical observations contained in the OSCE report, for example that the political parties have had unequal access to television coverage.
I also reject the use of violence of any kind, whether perpetrated by individuals or by the state authority.
We should not, however, forget the apparent facts which proved so misleading in policy-making before the conflicts in Yugoslavia and in Iraq.
Secondly, we should bear in mind that what we say about Minsk today will hold true for Kiev tomorrow.
It is my belief, and it has already been stated before this House, that we all want Belarus to become a member of the European concert in a dignified manner.
In my opinion, the way to aid this process is not to impose isolation, but to provide help for the ordinary Belarussian people.
Belarussians should feel that the European Union is keen to see a stable and democratic neighbour on its eastern border, which respects the right to free elections.
I believe that we will achieve this not by means of resolutions alone, but also by means of concrete actions, for example by stepping up aid for people in areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, by helping resolve the issues of migration and border protection, by facilitating greater communication between students and by supporting civil initiatives.
These are all tools which may improve the situation for ordinary people, those for whom democracy is most important, in my opinion.
The next item is the Commission statement: Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers.
President of the European Commission. - Commissioner Oettinger gave a very precautionary and very prudent statement.
It may happen, but to check if it can or not, we have to make serious, credible tests.
This is what we are going to do, in full transparency and based on the best available expertise.
As you know, it is not within the Commission's competence to shut down the tests.
This is a national competence.
What we are going to do - and, unlike previously, before the last European Council, we have a clear mandate to do it - is work with the national independent regulators to conduct very serious, credible State stress tests.
We are now defining the modalities and the scope of those stress tests.
I would like to tell Mr Schulz that, in these various sensitive matters, we have to be extremely responsible and not create panic.
We have to proceed in a technical way, based on the best scientific expertise.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to compliment the rapporteur on his excellent work.
This report achieves a twofold objective: it reinforces measures to combat smoking by extending the financing of the European Tobacco Fund whilst at the same time bringing the tobacco sector into line with the other CMOs which will naturally terminate with the 2012 financial year.
However, the fight against smoking must not mean the end of tobacco growing in Europe, because Europe is the world's leading importer of raw tobacco and relies for over 75% of its requirements on third countries, to the benefit of tobaccos often produced without any guaranteed health controls.
Any cancellation of the aid would lead merely to the end of production, to increased imports and would have no effect on smoking.
Brussels, 08 March 2005
Questions & Answers on Emissions Trading and National Allocation Plans
1) What is the aim of emissions trading?
The Emission Trading Scheme[1] (ETS) is a cornerstone in the fight against climate change.
It is the first international trading system for CO2 emissions in the world.
It covers over 11.500 energy-intensive installations across the EU, which represent close to half of Europe’s emissions of CO2.
These installations include combustion plants, oil refineries, coke ovens, iron and steel plants, and factories making cement, glass, lime, brick, ceramics, pulp and paper.
The aim of the EU ETS is to help EU Member States achieve compliance with their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
2) What determines the price of allowances?
The Commission has no view on what the price of allowances should be.
The price is a function of supply and demand as in any other free market.
Market intermediaries quote prices for allowances offered or bid for.
The Commission will not intervene in the allowance market.
Should distortions occur, competition law would be applicable as with any other market.
3) What is the purpose of national allocation plans?
The National Allocation Plans (NAPs) determine the total quantity of CO2 emissions that Member States grant to their companies, which can then be sold or bought by the companies themselves.
This means each Member State must ex-ante decide how many allowances to allocate in total for a trading period and how many each plant covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme will receive.
The first trading period runs from 2005-2007, the second one from 2008-2012, and the third one will start in 2013.
4) Based on which criteria did the Commission assess the allocation plans for the first period?
Will there by any differences in the assessment of the plans for the second trading period?
The assessment of the allocation plans is based on the 12 common criteria in Annex III to the Directive on Emission Trading.
For the 2005-2007 trading period, 11 criteria were relevant.
Criterion 1 provides that the proposed total quantity of allowances must be in line with a Member State’s Kyoto target.
This means that a Member State should make sure that the allocations that they grant their plants will allow it to meet its Kyoto target.
Of course, the Member State can and should also take other measures.
Other sectors also generate greenhouse gas emissions: in the EU, transport is responsible for 21% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, households and small businesses for 17% and agriculture for 10%.
So, Member States can and should also take measures to reduce emissions in these sectors.
In addition, Member States can plan to purchase emission credits through Kyoto's flexible project-based instruments Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) and international emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol.
CDM and JI allow governments to implement emission-reduction projects abroad and count the achieved reductions against their own Kyoto targets.
JI projects can be undertaken in other industrialised countries with Kyoto targets, while CDM projects can be hosted by developing countries, which under the Protocol have no targets.
All these measures and their projected results must be mentioned in the allocation plans.
Under criterion 1 the Commission assesses whether the emission levels of the industries that participate in Emission Trading, alongside these other measures, will enable the Member State to meet its Kyoto targets.
As only the combined effect of different policies and measures will allow Member States to achieve their targets, the Directive speaks of the “path” to Kyoto.
A number of other criteria also ask Member States to assess emissions developments and potentials for reductions in all sectors.
In addition, there are criteria that seek to ensure non-discrimination between companies and between the different sectors as well as compliance with the EU's competition and state aid rules.
Other criteria relate to provisions in the plan for new entrants, the accommodation of early reduction efforts and clean technology.
The Directive foresees that the procedure for assessing plans for the second trading period (2008 to 2012) stays the same and is based on the same set of criteria, except for two issues.
Under criterion 1 it will be necessary to assess not only whether the plan puts the Member State on its path to Kyoto, but rather whether the plan, together with other policies and measures, will guarantee the achievement of the Member State’s Kyoto target.
Under the Linking Directive, Member States will set limits to guarantee that a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions still takes place within the European Union, and not abroad.
The Commission published guidance on the implementation of these allocation criteria in early January 2004.
If the Commission finds that a plan is not in line with the criteria and the EU Treaty it can, in part or in full, reject it.
If the Commission has not rejected any aspect of its plan, the Member State can proceed to take a final allocation decision.
The Commission's decision has to be taken within three months from the date a Member State notifies a national allocation plan to the Commission.
5) Does this mean that a Member State cannot issue as many allowances as it wants?
Yes.
The quantity of allowances a Member State may issue is governed by the 12 criteria.
The Directive does not explicitly prescribe a given number of allowances, but each Member State must respect the criteria.
This means that in practice their leeway is limited.
If a Member State were over-generous in issuing allowances, not only would the plan probably be failing to comply with some of the allocation criteria, but the Member State would also miss out on the opportunity to use the Emissions Trading Scheme as a tool to help it comply with Kyoto.
And if too many allowances were issued, there would be no scarcity so no market would develop.
6) When and with which results did the Commission assess the national allocation plans for the first trading period?
It accepted five plans unconditionally (Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden), and partially rejected the other three - those of Austria, Germany and the UK.
It accepted six plans unconditionally (Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg the Slovak Republic and Portugal), and conditionally approved the other two - those of Finland and France.
In late December 2004, the Commission concluded the assessment of a third set of five plans.
In each case of conditional approvals, the Commission indicated the steps that need to be taken by the Member State to make the plan fully acceptable.
7) For what reasons did the Commission require changes to plans?
The Commission identified problems in three areas of general importance:
if the allocation chosen by a Member State for the 2005-2007 trading period jeopardises the achievement of its Kyoto target (excessive allocation)
if the volume of allowances for the 2005-2007 trading period is inconsistent with assessment of progress towards the Kyoto target, i.e. the allocation exceeds projected emissions
if a Member State intends to make so-called “ex-post adjustments” to allocations.
This means that the Member States plans to intervene in the market after the allocation is done, and redistribute the issued allowances among the participating companies during the 2005-2007 trading period.
Excessive allocation can result from various cases:
Firstly, where a Member State does not reason how the Kyoto target in 2008-2012 would be respected, but left a gap to be closed with measures to be defined later.
Secondly, where a Member State states the intention to purchase Kyoto credits, but does not demonstrate credible and reliable steps to realise these purchases.
Thirdly, where a Member State bases its plan on projections (including economic and emission growth rates) that are inconsistent and exaggerated compared to official growth forecasts by the Member State itself or other impartial sources.
Ex-post adjustments are incompatible with the legal framework and represent interventions that disrupt the market and create uncertainty for companies.
For example, if a company faces the possibility that the government may take away allowances after it has reduced its emissions, it will hesitate to do so.
And if companies think they can receive additional allowances for free from their governments, they will pursue this route rather than turn to the market and buy allowances.
It has demanded cuts in the number of allowances to be allocated in 14 out of the 25 plans.
In addition, the Commission has disallowed intended ex-post adjustments in 13 plans.
8) What happens if the Commission rejects a national allocation plan?
A rejection of a national allocation plan means that the Member State may not proceed to implement the plan as it stands, i.e. may not allocate the number of allowances proposed.
The Commission must give reasons in any rejection decision.
These reasons will give guidance to the Member State on how to make the plan compatible with the allocation criteria.
If the Member States whose plans were partially rejected implement the proposed changes they will not have to submit their plans to the Commission a second time, but automatically qualify for emissions trading.
9) What steps follow in the allocation process after the Commission's approval of a (revised) plan?
10) Can a Member State change the plan after Commission approval?
After the approval of the Commission a Member State has to proceed to take a final allocation decision at national level.
Before doing so, it can make changes to the number of allowances for individual plants as a result of improved data, e.g. if historic emissions data are used for a plant-level allocation formula.
A Member State may, however, under no circumstance increase the total number of allowances it intends to put into circulation.
Once the final allocation decision at national level has been taken and the final plan is published, no more changes whatsoever to the number of allowances in total or per plant can be made.
The final allocation decision concludes the allocation process and opens formally the market for allowances in the Member State.
11) Do Member States have a say on each other’s plans?
While the Commission has the sole responsibility to assess the plans, the Directive provides that the Climate Change Committee, consisting of Member State representatives, considers each plan.
This Committee is a forum to debate each plan.
The Commission, as the Committee’s chair, is following this debate and takes the conclusions into account in its assessments.
As a general point, the Climate Change Committee has stressed the importance of national allocation plans to ensure the functioning and effectiveness of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and maintain and strengthen the EU's international leadership and credibility on climate change.
12) What is the role of participating companies, Member States and the Commission now that the EU ETS has kicked off?
At the end of each year, they have to produce a report on annual emissions, which will be verified by a third party (similar to an auditor verifying the financial accounts of a company).
At the same time, they have to make sure that they are in possession of a sufficient number of allowances to surrender year by year (first surrender date is end of April 2006) so not to be subject to financial sanctions.
Each Member State will also have to produce a regular annual report to the Commission.
The Commission operates the European hub of the registry system, and will prepare an annual report on the basis of Member States reports.
It closely follows the performance of, and reviews the experience with, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
In preparation of this report the Commission will seek input from stakeholders.
13) How much will it cost to reach the Kyoto targets?
Will the Emissions Trading Scheme jeopardise Europe’s competitiveness?
This depends on the set of measures chosen.
One of the underlying principles of the European Climate Change Programme has consistently been to identify the most cost-effective measures to achieve the Kyoto targets.
Recent Commission studies conclude that the targets can be achieved at an annual cost of €2.9 to €3.7 billion, which is less than 0.1 % of GDP in the EU.
One of these studies concluded that without the Emissions Trading Scheme costs could reach € 6.8 billion.
So emission trading allows the costs of Kyoto to be reduced even further.
How these costs are distributed depends on the decisions taken in the allocation plans and on further measures adopted to control emissions in sectors not covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme.
The scheme will not jeopardise, but rather protect, the competitiveness of the EU economy, as any alternative measures would mean imposing higher than necessary costs on EU businesses.
Implementing Kyoto will, however, mean not only new economic opportunities but also costs for EU businesses.
This is unavoidable – we cannot have something (i.e.
Kyoto compliance) for nothing.
Europe gets the best value for money with the Emissions Trading Scheme.
If governments do not use the trading scheme to assist compliance, more costly measures will have to be imposed on other sectors.
Costs have to be seen in relation to the opportunities arising for suppliers of clean, low-carbon technologies in Europe and beyond and the medium-term advantage for European industry in the transition to a low-carbon global economy.
The “Linking Directive”[2] further lowers the costs and protects the competitiveness of EU businesses.
In principle, companies which carry out emission reduction projects outside the EU through JI or CDM can convert the credits they earn from those projects into allowances that can be used for compliance under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
The Linking Directive will therefore further lower the cost to EU industry by offering more options for complying with the requirements of the Emissions Trading Scheme.
CDM is already operational, so that European companies running CDM projects can use the earned credits for compliance during the first trading period.
JI projects will kick off in 2008 with the beginning of the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which also marks the beginning of the second trading period under the EU ETS (2008-2012).
However, preparations for JI projects are already underway.
14) Will emissions trading lead to higher electricity prices?
It is important to distinguish between the target and the instrument in this debate.
Changes in electricity prices will not be a consequence of emissions trading, but of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol sets a cap on allowable greenhouse gas emissions, which means that the EU economy is becoming a carbon-constrained economy.
This carbon constraint gives value to the allowances and leads to changes in relative prices in the EU economy.
Goods that contain more carbon will be relatively more expensive than goods that contain less carbon.
As the trading scheme is the cheapest way to implement Kyoto, it means that any price changes will be the lowest necessary.
Many studies have been put forward about the likely development of power prices and a wide range of estimates are available.
Pricing decisions in the liberalised power market are increasingly complex and difficult to predict.
There are many events that directly affect the electricity price, emission trading is just one of them.
There are structural aspects such as the liberalisation of the energy market and variations in the internal energy market that have very far-reaching effects.
The Commission will carefully monitor the development of power prices and all other aspects related to the Emissions Trading Scheme.
15) How will companies benefit from emissions trading?
Let’s say that companies A and B both emit 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.
The government gives each of them 95,000 emission allowances.
One allowance represents the right to emit 1 tonne of CO2.
So, neither company is fully covered for its emissions.
At the end of each year, the companies have to surrender a number of allowances corresponding to their emissions during the year, whatever the emissions of the individual company are.
If they fail to do so, they face a fine of € 40 per missing allowance during the 2005-2007 trading period, and € 100 during the second 2008-2012 trading period.
They have two ways of doing this.
They can either reduce their emissions by 5,000 tonnes, or purchase 5,000 allowances in the market.
In order to decide which option to pursue, they will compare the costs of reducing their emissions by 5,000 tonnes with the market price for allowances.
For the sake of the example, let’s say that the allowance market price is € 10 per tonne of CO2.
Company A’s reduction costs are € 5 (i.e. lower than the market price).
Company A will reduce its emissions, because it is cheaper than buying allowances.
Company A may even reduce its emissions by more than 5,000 tonnes, say 10,000 tonnes.
Company A spends € 50,000 on reducing 10,000 tonnes at a cost of € 5 per tonne and receives € 50,000 from selling 5,000 tonnes at a price of € 10.
So Company A fully offsets its emission reduction costs by selling allowances, whereas without the Emissions Trading Scheme it would have had a net cost of € 25,000 to bear.
Company B spends € 50,000 on buying 5,000 tonnes at a price of € 10.
In the absence of the flexibility provided by the Emissions Trading Scheme, company B would have had to spend € 75,000.
Since only a company that has low reduction costs and therefore has chosen to reduce its emissions, like Company A, is able to sell, the allowances that Company B buys represent a reduction of emissions, even if Company B did not itself reduce emissions.
This is important to remember.
This ensures that the cheapest reductions are made first.
Since the scheme is EU-wide, companies will seek out the cheapest reductions in the whole of the EU and ensure that they are made first.
It is this flexibility in the system which makes emissions trading the most cost-effective manner of achieving a given environmental target.
The overall cost to industry would have been higher if Company B had been forced to reduce emissions at its own plant at a higher cost.
16) How does allowance trading work in practice?
The legal framework of the trading scheme does not regulate how and where the market in allowances takes place.
Companies with commitments may trade allowances directly with each other, or they may buy or sell via a broker, bank or other allowance market intermediary.
It could also be the case that a company purchasing a fossil fuel (coal or gas) will be offered allowances in combination with the fuel.
This registry system is separate from trading activity - not all trades result in changes in ownership of allowances, but where a trade culminates in a change in ownership, there is a transfer of allowances between accounts in the registry system.
In this way, the registry system is similar to a banking system which keeps track of the ownership of money in accounts, but does not track the deals made in the goods and services markets, which are the cause of the money changing hands.
So the registry system is not a marketplace; the way in which allowances are traded is a decision made by the participants in the market.
The system is purely electronic, and so allowances are not printed on paper but exist only in an online registry account.
Each company with a commitment and any person interested in buying or selling allowances need to open an account.
The system consists of a national component in each Member State where the allowances are held and of a hub at European level, which will conduct automated checks on each transfer of allowances to ensure that the rules of the Directive are respected.
Some of the data held in the registry will be released periodically, in accordance with UN rules and the Electronic Registries Regulation[3].
A balance has been sought between environmental transparency and commercial confidentiality.
17) Are all the national registries operational?
Other Member States are still working on finalising the launch of their registries.
18) What are the next steps?
The Commission is closely monitoring the functioning of the EU ETS.
This report may be accompanied by proposals for amendments to the scheme.
The results of the survey will help the Commission establish whether it would be appropriate to propose amendments.
However, it is important to note that any amendments to the Directive that the Commission proposes in 2006 would most likely only have an effect as from the third trading period beginning in 2013.
This is because of the time needed for the legislative procedure and because the national allocation plans for the second trading period have to be submitted already in mid-2006, at the same time as the report is published.
The survey will also inform the elaboration of allocation plans for the second trading period 2008-2012.

Commission proposes improved rules to enforce EU rights under international trade agreements
The Commission is today proposing a new framework to enhance the EU's ability to enforce its rights in the international trading system.
Ensuring the EU's trade partners respect the agreed trade rules is essential to make trade agreements work for the EU economy.
"The EU's membership in the World Trade Organisation and bilateral trade agreements help the EU economy.
Those agreements must be respected for them to deliver results.
The proposal is for an EU Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament and will now be discussed by the Council and the European Parliament under the ordinary legislative procedure.
Background
The proposal is part of the Commission's broader objective to improve the exercise of EU rights for the enforcement of international trade rules.
Specifically, the EU committed to step up its efforts to enforce its rights under bilateral and multilateral agreements to open markets that are illegally closed.
The Commission's proposal intends to remedy to the current situation where the EU does not have a single horizontal framework to react swiftly and efficiently on enforcing international trade rulings.
The establishment of a framework of rules is needed following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, under which legislative and executive functions are clearly divided between EU institutions.

Running From the Ruble
PARIS – In recent weeks, the fall in the Russian ruble and Russian stock markets closely tracked the declines in global oil prices.
But everything changed on December 15.
The oil price remained stable, but the ruble and the stock-price indices lost 30% in the subsequent 24 hours.
An unprecedented effort by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) in the wee hours of December 16 to stabilize the ruble, by hiking the interest rate from 10.5% to 17%, proved useless.
The cause of Russia’s “Black Monday” was readily apparent: the government bailout of state-owned Rosneft, the country’s largest oil company.
Usually, bailouts calm markets; but this one recalled early post-Soviet experiments, when the CBR issued direct loans to enterprises – invariably fueling higher inflation.
The CBR’s governor at the time, Viktor Gerashchenko, was once dubbed the world’s worst central banker.
In 2014, the CBR is more constrained than it was in Gerashchenko’s era: it cannot lend directly to firms.
Yet it has also become more sophisticated at achieving the same ends that Gerashchenko sought.
In October, Rosneft issued $11 billion worth of ruble-denominated bonds (an unparalleled amount for the Russian market, equivalent to 70% of the total value of corporate bonds issued in Russia this year).
The coupon on these bonds was actually 1.5 percentage points below sovereign bonds of similar maturity, which is also unusual, especially given that Rosneft currently is subject to Western sanctions.
Then, unnamed investors (allegedly the largest Russian state banks) benefited from the CBR’s decision on December 12 to allow these bonds to be used as collateral for three-year CBR ruble loans at the policy rate.
Moreover, the CBR scheduled a special auction for such loans on December 15 – with the total amount of the loans similar to that of Rosneft’s bond issue.
Thus, the CBR would be able to provide a massive pile of rubles to Rosneft at below-market rates.
So why did the deal trigger a panic?
At first glance, this deal was intended to meet contemporary Russia’s most important economic challenge.
Sanctions have cut off Russian banks and companies from Western financial markets.
Russian companies have to repay or refinance about $300 billion of debt over the coming two years.
Some of this debt is owed to Russian companies’ offshore owners, who will certainly be happy to roll it over.
But in most cases, firms’ liabilities comprise real debt owed to major international banks.
The best example is Rosneft, which borrowed about $40 billion in 2013 to buy its competitor, TNK-BP.
About $10 billion of this debt has to be repaid in the fourth quarter of 2014, including a $7 billion payment on December 21 ($20 billion more will have to be repaid in 2015).
Financial-market investors have been waiting patiently for the government to announce a strategy for addressing the issue of external corporate debt.
The CBR did introduce a 12-month dollar facility for up to $50 billion, but this will barely last until the end of 2015.
Given that the price of oil is likely to remain low, Asian financiers – even the Chinese – do not seem eager to refinance Russian companies, and sanctions are unlikely to be lifted, investors clearly wanted a bigger and bolder solution.
Rosneft had repeatedly asked for $40 billion from Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.
But, with that money already committed to other purposes, the government opted for a non-transparent and non-market-based solution that would have made Gerashchenko proud.
Unfortunately, this solution poses several immediate problems.
For starters, the risk of Rosneft defaulting – as well as the cost of providing subsidized loans – rests with the bondholders.
If the bondholders are indeed the largest state-owned banks, the deal actually hurts the banking system: it increases the concentration of risk and implies additional losses from buying bonds with below-market interest rates.
Second, because Rosneft must repay its external debt, it is likely to use its bailout cash to buy dollars, which can only result in further downward pressure on the ruble.
Rosneft has denied this publicly, but the markets nonetheless seem to expect that the newly printed rubles will flood the currency markets.
Third, the non-transparent structure of the deal undermines trust in the CBR’s integrity and independence.
The day after Black Monday, Minister of Economy Alexey Ulyukaev said that the CBR should have increased interest rates sooner.
This immediately raised suspicion that the CBR delayed the interest-rate hike in order to complete the deal at the lower rate.
Finally, this bailout fails to answer the question it was supposed to address.
Investors do not know whether the Rosneft bailout is a one-off deal and, if it is not, which companies can hope to receive similar treatment from the CBR.
Thus, they do not understand how (and whether) Russian corporate debt will be repaid or refinanced – or how much trust they can place in the ruble.
The Middle East’s Moment of Truth
JERUSALEM: Whatever the outcome of the summit convened by President Clinton at Camp David between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and PLO Chairman Yassar Arafat, one thing is clear: the moment of truth for Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations has arrived.
Defections from Prime Minister Barak’s government and coalition, including the resignation of his foreign minister, David Levy, who refused to accompany Barak to Washington, will make the negotiations even more dramatic.
Israel and the Palestinians have been negotiating since 1995, when they signed the Oslo Accords whose major achievement was mutual recognition and autonomy in areas of the West Bank and Gaza for the Palestinians.
Further negotiations were to decide the final status of the Palestinian Authority (ie, whether Palestine is to be an independent state), the border issue, the future of Jewish settlements, whether refugees could return to their homes, and the final status of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital but which Israel controls in its entirety.
According to a series of agreements signed over the years within this framework, a Palestinian Authority, with Yassar Arafat as its head, was established.
Arafat returned from exile in Tunis to Gaza, and Israel turned over to the Palestinian Authority most of Gaza and most of the towns in the West Bank.
Today, although the Palestinian Authority controls less than 30% of the West Bank and Gaza, over 80% of Palestinians in these territories live under Palestinian rule, free from Israeli military occupation.
A Palestinian legislature and cabinet have opened, as well as Palestinian police and security services.
The economy in areas under Palestinian control is administered by the Palestinian Authority, as are education and other internal matters.
While economic results are mixed, the most important change in the daily life of Palestinians is that most no longer live under Israeli rule.
Yet Jewish settlements, built mainly under the right-wing governments of Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, and Benjamin Netanyahu, remain in place, and relations between settlers - some of them extremely radical nationalists - and Palestinians remain raw.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination by a nationalist-religious extremist Jewish student slowed the peace process, especially after Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister in 1996.
But in 1999 Ehud Barak, Labour’s leader, was elected Prime Minister in a sweeping personal victory that restored momentum to the peace negotiations.
It is this new momentum that now may drive the process.
Although most territorial issues have been negotiated, the most difficult ones, which were intentionally left to the latter stages of the negotiations, now must be addressed. Here is where the whole process will stand or fall.
What will be the status of Jerusalem?
To go back to the 1967 dividing lines, which cut the city in two, is impossible, especially as over 120,000 Israelis now live across the old dividing line.
What will be the future of Jewish settlements?
Should they stay, be partly evacuated, or be put partly under Palestinian rule?
These are the thorny problems, which combine political, strategic, religious and symbolic issues that transcend the human dimensions of what is to happen to the populations - Jewish and Arab - involved.
The weakening political positions of the leaders complicates matters even more.
Prime Minister Barak’s position suffers from a very brittle coalition, and he has recently lost his parliamentary majority.
Arafat is under pressure from his extremists.
In the past he condoned acts of violence against Israelis in order to please fundamentalist radicals, which greatly diminished the trust of the Israeli public (and not only of right-wing extremists) in Arafat’s credibility and reliability.
It is under these circumstances that an outside push is required, and this is what President Clinton provided in launching this week’s Camp David talks.
If no agreement on the last remaining issues is achieved, escalation will ensue: the Palestinians may declare independence unilaterally; Israel may retaliate; the delicate balance of Oslo may unravel.
Prime Minister Barak appears ready to accept an independent Palestinian state - something no Israeli leader has, until now, been willing to do.
He has made clear that perhaps 30,000 settlers, may be evacuated to Israel proper or could remain in their homes under Palestinian rule.
This is a courageous and novel Israeli step, with an enormous price paid by Barak.
But the Palestinians want all the settlers to leave, a political impossibility for any Israeli government.
Mutually unacceptable positions are also voiced on both sides on the Jerusalem issue.
This is why a compromise is needed - and will in all probability be reached at Camp David.
It is difficult for Barak and Arafat, when in conclave with Clinton, to allow America’s President to fail.
The Camp David talks will likely witness a series of tough bargaining rounds with ups and downs, real and concocted crises, and a lot of tip-toeing to the edge by both sides.
But the logic of the situation is that, sooner or later, perhaps after a crisis or two, compromise will be found.
Reaching that point will be arduous for both sides, but as President Clinton said when announcing the summit, the alternative is far worse.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the two rapporteurs.
Ladies first, and not only these days, I will start by thanking Ms Herczog for the quality of her report on the Small Business Act (SBA) and the strong support it provides for the Commission's initiative to establish a comprehensive policy on small- and medium-sized enterprises.
I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lehne, not only for his efficiency and work in steering the Private Company Statute through the consultation procedure, but also for the interesting and creative solutions presented in the report.
We are now really in a critical phase.
We listen every day to the messages, such as the need to boost and renew confidence in the functioning of the global economy.
The financial and economic crisis has hit European businesses really hard, and I believe that it is now more important than ever to exploit to the full the potential of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
This is the very lifeline of the European economy.
The Small Business Act, which the Commission adopted in June 2008, provides a comprehensive framework of short-, medium- and long-term actions for SME growth and competitiveness within the Lisbon Strategy.
It proposes 10 policy principles and a number of concrete initiatives to make sure that the concerns of SMEs are placed at the centre of decision-making - as Ms Herczog said, mainstreaming SMEs into the centre of attention and strategies.
The SBA includes a set of legislative initiatives, including the proposal for a European private company statute.
The SBA is designed to ensure that the 'think small first' principle and priority for small businesses are lastingly and irreversibly anchored in policy-making across the Union.
The SBA also calls for greater recognition of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs.
We need people who are prepared to take initiatives, draft projects and take risks more than ever at times like this.
We also believe, therefore, that honest entrepreneurs who suffer business failure deserve a second chance.
In the current economic crisis, we need to establish priorities and focus on delivering quickly on those actions which have the strongest potential to contribute to recovery.
The SBA action plan and the European economic recovery plan propose ambitious measures in three key areas: first, loosening the supply of much-needed credit; secondly, reducing the administrative burden; and, thirdly, helping SMEs do business abroad.
Making a success of the Small Business Act depends on the seamless cooperation of all stakeholders.
We are grateful for your support.
The resolution that Parliament adopted in early December was a timely and strongly welcomed initiative.
As you know, at the summit later in December, the Heads of State and Government unanimously endorsed the Small Business Act, under the French Presidency.
It is, therefore, important that this House gives its full support today to Ms Herczog's report, to establish a solid and legitimate basis for further action.
I would like to invite you to promote the Small Business Act in your respective countries and your constituencies to help make sure that this ambitious policy programme becomes reality and that it really helps SMEs in their daily business.
Let me turn now to Mr Lehne's two reports.
Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the European Private Company Statute.
Your own-initiative report of 2006 and your swift handling of the Commission's proposal are important contributions to the success of the new European Company Statute.
The Private Company Statute is a key element of the Small Business Act.
It is designed for SMEs.
Therefore, the Commission proposed that a European private company may be set up just like any domestic company, without the requirement for doing business in different Member States or having shareholders from more than one country - just like at home.
There are those who consider such a cross-border requirement essential for a European company forum.
Parliament's resolution, which allows companies a choice between a variety of cross-border elements, is flexible.
European private companies could comply with this requirement, for example by setting up a foreign subsidiary or by simply recording their intention to do cross-border business.
You have also suggested a flexible solution for the minimum capital requirement.
As you know, the Commission's proposal required a minimum capital of just EUR 1, and beyond that left it to the shareholders to decide on how much capital their European private company needs.
This provision has been questioned by those who consider that capital requirements have a role in protecting the creditors of small companies.
The European Parliament report has put forward alternative solutions to improve creditor protection.
It means companies would be able to choose between a solvency-based or capital-maintenance-based creditor protection regime.
The Commission agrees with those elements of the report that aim to increase the uniformity of the statute and thus promote the legal certainty of its application.
These include prescribing the registration of the company's business object, clarifying that the ban on offering shares to the public does not preclude offers to the employees of the company, or improving the rules on directors' duties and liabilities.
All of these make a helpful contribution which will facilitate the application of this statute.
I also welcome your useful suggestion of an arbitration clause which encourages the shareholders to use alternative means of dispute resolution.
Finally, I should like to mention the subject that has been the most debated in Parliament and elsewhere, which is workers' participation on the board of European private companies.
As I have already mentioned, the Commission designed a statute for smaller businesses.
Employee participation in SMEs exists only in a few Member States, and this is why a solution based on national laws, which would allow for the coexistence of different models, seemed the most appropriate and reasonable approach.
Parliament's amendments introduce additional and complex provisions that are not applicable to SMEs formed under national law in most Member States.
This is likely to make the European Private Company Statute unattractive in those Member States and a much less viable option for SMEs.
To conclude, there are a number of useful solutions in your report.
Some of them could very well pave the way for a swifter compromise among the Member States.
The Commission, therefore, welcomes the adoption of this report.
Finally, regarding the cross-border transfer of the seat of companies: the Commission has informed Parliament on previous occasions of its reasons for not proposing the 14th Company Law Directive.
These reasons are still valid.
We agree with the rapporteur that companies should enjoy freedom of establishment within the single market and be able to move their seats from one country to another.
However, we are not convinced that proposing new legislation now is the best solution to achieve this objective.
Court of Justice case-law clearly allows for company mobility.
In addition, existing legislation - the Cross-Border Mergers Directive - provides a framework for the transfer, including the necessary safeguards for third parties.
In particular, the Cross-Border Mergers Directive allows a company to set up a new subsidiary in another country and then merge its existing company with that subsidiary.
The transfer procedure and safeguards suggested by the Committee on Legal Affairs are very similar to those put forward by the Directive.
Our economic analyses show that the level of complexity of the cross-border transfer procedure would be comparable to that of the cross-border merger procedure.
The Cross-Border Mergers Directive was due to be transposed by Member States by December 2007.
It is too early to assess its full application.
Before embarking on any new legislation, the Commission should first evaluate how this new existing regulatory framework operates in practice.
We are also not convinced that the Directive would improve the existing situation under national law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice in this area.
Finally, in the light of the above and with the current legislature about to end, it would be more appropriate for the next Commission to decide on how to proceed on this issue of the transfer of a company's registered office.
By then it will also become clearer how the issue of seat transfer was solved in the SPE Statute.
. The Commission has investigated the complaints it received in connection with the public service contracts awarded by the company Trasagua and has come to the conclusion that this entity must be regarded as a public law body within the meaning of the community directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public service contracts.
The Commission therefore takes the view that the provisions of the public service contract directives are applicable to this entity when it awards a contract falling within the scope of these directives and that the environmental impact assessment contract referred to by the honourable Member should have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
In a letter to me dated 19 June 2003 Mr Martinez Fernandez, State Secretary for Coastline and Waterways in the Spanish Environment Ministry, acknowledges that this analysis of the Commission is correct.
And in the same letter he gives the undertaking that from now on the company Trasagua will apply the relevant provisions of the EC directives in full whenever it awards contracts.
The Commission wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that the Trasagua case must be placed in the broader context of the compatibility of the Spanish provisions for the implementation of the community concept of public law body.
The Spanish Act under which the public service contract directives are implemented does after all exclude private entities from its scope, even if they conform to the definition of public law body within the meaning of the community directives.
In this context the Commission has on various occasions taken action under Article 226 for failure to fulfil obligations.
The Court of Justice for example recently found Spain guilty of the incorrect application of the directive on working on the construction of a prison.
Another case relating to the more general problem of the incorrect implementation of the personnel scope of the directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public works contracts and of public supply contracts has still to come before the Court.
In addition, on 11 July of this year the Commission decided to declare Spain in default on the same grounds in relation to Directive 92/50/EEC concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts.
Brussels, 14 December 2007
The European Commission, together with 26 participating Member States of the European Union[1], and JT International (JTI) today announced a multi-year agreement that includes an efficient system to fight against future cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting.
Through the Agreement, JTI will work with the European Commission, its anti-fraud office OLAF, and law enforcement authorities of the Member States to help in the fight against contraband, including the problem of counterfeit cigarettes.
“I welcome the conclusion of the negotiations of this important agreement.
“Contraband and counterfeit products cheat everyone: governments, consumers and legitimate businesses.
This new agreement will further enhance the ability of the European Commission and of the Member States to combat the illegal trade in cigarettes, which results in the loss of substantial tax and customs revenues each year.
It sends a strong signal to the world that agreements between authorities and industry to fight illegal trade work and bring substantial benefits,”
Fight against counterfeit
In addition, counterfeit and other forms of contraband create a parallel illegal supply chain that invades and compromises legitimate distribution channels and competes unfairly with genuine products distributed through legitimate channels.
Over the last few years, the incidence of contraband JTI cigarettes has been greatly reduced, but during the same time period, counterfeit cigarettes have become a growing threat to the European Community and the Member States.
Fight against contraband and money laundering: Know your customers and tracking and tracing
The Agreement builds on the efforts of all parties and introduces innovative procedures to combat the diversion of JTI’s products into contraband channels in Europe and around the world.
The Agreement contains strong provisions, approved by all parties, which provide them with a mechanism for the long-term prevention of any large-scale smuggling of genuine Japan Tobacco cigarettes in the European market.
The Agreement requires JTI to build on its existing review process for selecting and monitoring customers, to enhance its capabilities to track and trace certain packaging, and to provide expanded support to European law enforcement in its battle against the illegal trade in cigarettes.
Under the Agreement, JTI agrees to continue limiting its sales to volumes commensurate with legitimate market demand.
The Agreement also incorporates and builds into a comprehensive contractual framework JTI’s existing compliance programmes.
Historically, a key concern for the European Community has been the introduction of contraband cigarettes into the European Community.
For that reason, the European Community has taken vigorous action to address cigarette smuggling.
European law-enforcement efforts have resulted over the past several years in the reduction of the amount of cigarettes that enter the EU as contraband.
The initiative includes far-reaching product-tracking procedures that will facilitate law enforcement efforts to determine the point at which any genuine product is diverted from the authorised sales channel.
Consistent with the Agreement, JTI will mark certain packaging with information indicating the intended market of retail sale, mark “master cases”[2] of cigarettes with machine-scannable barcode labels, and implement other procedures useful for the tracking and tracing of its products.
Obligations under the Agreement
The European Community and the participating Member States will receive substantial payments over a number of years.
The Agreement also includes a guarantee by JTI to make payments in the event of future seizures in the European Community of its genuine products above defined quantities.
These payments will be made without regard to fault or wrongdoing by JTI.
These payments will be available to all participating Member States.
The Agreement excludes any future lawsuits against JTI for civil claims arising out of past conduct related to the manufacture, sale, distribution or storage of cigarettes.
The parties have therefore agreed on a framework and a timetable in which JTI will bring former Gallaher entities up to the standards of the Agreement, with a view to bringing them within the full scope of the Agreement.
Other future Agreements
The Commission is always prepared to have discussions with manufacturers who are willing to commit the necessary resources to improve ways to combat illegal trade in their products and associated criminal activity, such as money laundering.
Producers also have a responsibility to fight illegal trade in their products, in full cooperation with relevant government authorities.
This Agreement should therefore serve as a further model for those cigarette companies that have yet to assume fully such responsibilities.
Background
In the negotiations with JTI, the Commission represented the European Community and the Member States.
The Legal Service and OLAF conducted the negotiations for the Commission.
The agreement and its annexes are available on: http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/budget/cig_smug/2007_en.html
[1] The following Member States are participating Member States under the Agreement: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Spain.
[2] "Master case" means packaging for approximately 10,000 cigarettes.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, the main factor that attracts illegal immigrants today is illegal work.
Migrants will continue to come to Europe as long as they believe that the financial benefits they can gain from working illegally outweigh the risks of being arrested by European law enforcement bodies.
We need a common will at European level to implement an effective strategy against illegal work.
That is the key to this strategy and it depends on us, on the Member States and on our common political will.
This is the context surrounding the Commission proposal on sanctions for those who employ third-country nationals residing illegally in the European Union, which is currently being examined by this Parliament and by the Council.
This proposal seeks to ensure that all the Member States adopt preventive measures and similar sanctions and actually apply them in the fight against illegal work.
I would like to encourage Parliament to continue its examination of this proposal so that we can establish a Community instrument that requires the Member States to take all the necessary measures to ensure that the rule of law is respected throughout the European Union.
Having said that, I do not want to underestimate the challenges posed by illegal immigration across the European Union's external borders.
It is very likely that this year, too, many people from the African continent will be tempted to come to the EU by sea: some will come individually, some will come in small groups and others will be exploited by criminal organisations demanding large sums of money to bring them to Europe.
Considerable efforts have been made at European level to provide the Member States with the financial support needed in 2008.
The budget of the Frontex agency has practically doubled in 2008 compared with 2007.
This year it totals EUR 70 million, including more than EUR 31 million for operations at the EU's maritime borders.
As regards the operations in these high-risk zones, Frontex has organised four large-scale operations: Poseidon, Hermes, Nautilus and Hera.
The information on their exact dates and duration is not yet in the public domain but, thanks to the increase in funding, they will last longer than they did in 2007.
It is also important to point out that an agreement has been reached between the Member States and Frontex on the procedures and conditions for using the technical equipment contained in the Central Record of Available Technical Equipment (CRATE) database.
At present, 18 aircraft, 20 helicopters and 105 vessels are made available by the Member States on a voluntary basis.
For its part, Frontex provides the human resources needed to help the Member States to prepare and evaluate the maritime operations.
In its evaluation report on Frontex, the Commission recommended that the potential of CRATE and the commitments made by the Member States should be exploited to the full to ensure the availability of the necessary equipment for sea border operations.
The Frontex agency must report regularly to the European institutions on the actual use made of the equipment and the extent to which this use is adequate in relation to the needs, and it must inform them about a future mechanism to ensure the availability of the equipment offered by the Member States.
The agency could also increase the potential of CRATE by acquiring or leasing its own technical equipment.
Through these efforts, the Member States and Frontex will help to reduce, as far as possible, the disappearance at sea of those who to reach Europe in makeshift vessels.
As a result, the Commission welcomes the bilateral agreement between Spain and the West African states, as well as the contacts between Italy and Malta and Libya.
To date, the contacts with Libya have not had the desired result; all the more reason to pursue them.
In its report on the future development of Frontex, the Commission emphasised that cooperation with third countries is a key element in improving the joint operations carried out by the agency in the long term.
As such, consideration should be given to whether Frontex should have the possibility of carrying out pilot projects with third countries as beneficiaries. Of course, the agency must ensure coherence between its activities and the overall framework of the Union's external policy.
Such projects could significantly strengthen the impact of cooperation launched under the current working arrangements, where the latter can serve to identify concrete needs for capacity building with regard to border management in specific third countries.
Finally, the Commission sees 2008 as a test year.
Frontex has a larger overall budget, the CRATE database is fully operational and the rapid intervention teams are in place.
We will of course evaluate the results of these measures and, where necessary, it may be appropriate to explore other options, such as the establishment of a European border surveillance system, as indicated in the Commission's evaluation report.
That is the information I wanted to pass on to you today and I look forward to listening to the comments here in this House concerning these difficult problems.
Brussels, 26 th May 2010
For two days, the outermost regions are at the heart of Europe
The event will provide a better understanding among the European institutions and the Member States of the situation in the nine outermost regions (OR).
The Forum will also provide an opportunity to strengthen dialogue with these regions and exchange experience.
Another aim is to send a strong political message: the EU will continue to take account of the specific characteristics of these regions and support them with a view to transforming their potential into real growth opportunities.
This means, for example, strengthening their capabilities in the fields of research and renewable energy sources, or using their unique position to measure the effects of climate change.
I am determined to continue to develop the outermost regions, for their benefit and that of Europe as a whole.
Their many riches, often unknown in the rest of the European Union, provide an opportunity to strengthen economic diversity in order to emerge from the current crisis.'
This event brings together the Presidents of the outermost regions, the 27 EU Member States, representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, NGOs, universities and socio-professional circles and other experts.
The European Union's future strategy for the outermost regions from 2013 will be the focus of discussions in the Forum.
2010 is a pivotal year for these regions, given the ongoing discussions on the EU budget, the future cohesion policy after 2013 and the new economic strategy for Europe for 2020.
The ORs and their Member States also recently presented a memorandum to the European Commission summarising their joint ideas for the future ( IP/10/547 ).
Discussions will follow four main themes:
The cultural and natural heritage of the ORs
This heritage can drive development if properly exploited.
In addition, internationally-renowned jazz and blues festivals, such as those in Saint Lucia or Marie-Galante, may stimulate economic development.
Dynamic partnerships and active European borders
Given their location within three oceans, these regions play an important role in the Union's external action and in its neighbourhood policy.
For example, Guyana cooperates with Suriname and the Brazilian states of Amapá, Pará and Amazonas in developing cross-border economic activities and bringing the populations together.
Prospects for agriculture and fisheries
These form the backbone of the ORs' economy.
Where agriculture is concerned, they export a number of products (bananas, sugar cane, fruit, flowers, etc.).
They also benefit from impressive know-how in the agro-environmental and agri-food industries.
Their fisheries resources are rich and relatively well-preserved in comparison with continental Europe.
Sectors with development potential in these regions
The many examples of projects carried out by the ORs in the field of research and innovation illustrate their ability to overcome the constraints of their isolation and geomorphological characteristics.
They particularly excel in the fields of medical research, oceanography, aeronautics, agri-food and the development of renewable energy sources.
The European Commission's objective is to continue to support the modernisation of traditional sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and tourism, while developing new areas of activity with higher added value, such as information technology and green technologies.
The European Union is making specific financial efforts for these regions, and a number of actions are under way.
Specific public aid schemes and special tax regimes are being granted in order to take account of their situation.
Note to publishers
The European Union has nine outermost regions: the four French overseas departments (DOM) (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion and Martinique), two French overseas collectivities (Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin), the autonomous regions of Portugal (the Azores and Madeira) and the Spanish Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.
Since 1999 they have had a specific status recognised in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Diego López Garrido, Spain's Secretary of State for Maritime Affairs, Marie-Luce Penchard, France's Minister with responsibility for Overseas Territories, and Pedro Lourtie, Portugal's Secretary of State for European Affairs, will be taking part in the Forum.
In its 2008 communication, ' The outermost regions: an asset for Europe ', the Commission undertook to organise a forum for 'outermost Europe' every two years, together with the Member States and the OR.

EUR 50 million for new Joint Force of the Sahel countries: EU steps up its support for security in the region
The Joint Force will comprise troops from Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, and will operate in all five countries.
The initiative is designed to step up action on security, particularly in border areas.
The announcement was made by the High Representative/Vice-President, Federica Mogherini, who is taking part in the third EU-G5 Sahel ministerial meeting on her first official visit to Mali.
We need to unite our forces to tackle terrorism and all forms of trafficking, including human trafficking, and to improve the management of our borders.
Cooperation between the G5 Sahel countries is key to shoring up security in the Sahel.
We will continue to invest in development in Africa because it is an investment in our joint future.'
Ms Mogherini subsequently took part in a meeting with around 100 young people from the Sahel, the Maghreb, groups from the diaspora in Europe, and young Europeans.
The discussion focused on the opportunities that the EU and Africa can offer young people and on how to put young people at the forefront of development in Africa.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, recently, the situation in Belarus has been evolving rapidly.
Since mid-January, five of the six political prisoners previously identified as such have been released.
One of these political prisoners, though, former presidential candidate Aleksandr Kozulin, is still in jail and in a poor state of health.
The Commission, for its part, through my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, has expressed its satisfaction with the release of the prisoners, which has been a long-standing request from all EU institutions, including the European Parliament.
But we have equally been clear that we want to see all political prisoners freed, and that we want to see an end to the systematic harassment of Belarusian civil society, before we can give a new dimension to our relationship with Belarus.
In other words, our message to Belarus remains the same: there cannot be a full partnership with Belarus until Belarus takes convincing steps towards democratisation, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.
This is the gist of the European message to Belarus that the Commission released over a year ago and which includes the '12 points for democratisation' that your resolution mentions.
Again, the release of all political prisoners would be an important step in this regard.
In addition, we will be closely watching the parliamentary elections set for September 2008.
The organisation of free and fair elections would be seen as a decisive step on the part of the Belarusian authorities.
We hope that the OSCE will be able to send a full-scale observation mission to this election and that the European Parliament will also be able to send representatives.
Another important point that your resolution demands is that Belarus should apply a moratorium on the death penalty.
The European Union has carried this message to the Belarusian authorities.
Coming back now to the recent developments in Belarus, another issue close to our hearts has been progressing fast over the last months: the opening of the European Commission's delegation in Minsk, which we officially requested more than two years ago, is now imminent.
We hope to be able to sign the establishment agreement soon, so that our delegation can be opened without delay.
This delegation will allow us to reinforce our links with Belarusian civil society and also to develop contacts with the middle rank of the administration that could be open to democratic change.
On this matter, as your resolution underlines, we have had a number of meetings at technical level with Belarusian experts on matters of mutual interest, such as energy, transport and environment.
Let me, however, reiterate that the scope of these meetings remains limited as long as the current political conditions prevail in Belarus.
As regards to the Commission actions to support civil society in Belarus, the Commission remains committed more than ever to supporting Belarusian civil society, and our 2008 assistance plan is aimed in particular at cementing Belarusian civil society and independent media.
In addition, the Commission has also made clear that its support to the European Humanity University in exile in Vilnius will continue as long as necessary.
I will also pass the message about the Free University on to Commissioner Figeľ.
I think that this is very interesting and a bright idea.
A few other comments to Mr Pinior and Ms Schroedter.
The opening of the negotiations on visa facilitation and on readmission is amongst the elements that would be considered in the event of a real breakthrough in our relationship.
According to EU policy, visa facilitation can only be considered in the context of the European Commission readmission policy as part of a real partnership in external relations.
This was explained to Belarus in the verbal notes sent by the Commission on 8 May.
The European Union's willingness to enter into such negotiations with neighbouring countries with an action plan in force has also been reaffirmed, by the Commission communication on this matter of December 2006.
In the case of Belarus these conditions are not met.
On the point raised by Mr Bielan, Commission contracts are awarded following strict tendering procedures in order to ensure a transparent and fair competition.
This means that the Commission does not support radio and TV stations as such, but specific programmes instead.
The ENPI Regional Information and Communication Programme includes support to media activities of EUR 7 million over three years for seven countries.
The tendering procedure is ongoing, and media from both European Union and partner countries are eligible to submit tenders for contracts.

Single market for aviation to be extended to South East Europe
Today, the European Commission and eight South East European partners (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo) as well as Norway and Iceland reached an agreement to create a European Common Aviation Area.
“This is a major agreement which will put impetus on the political and economic integration of Europe, for which air transport plays a key role”, said Vice-President Jacques Barrot responsible for transport.
The negotiations on the ECAA Agreement with the South East European partners were launched in March 2005 and took less than a year to be concluded.
It is expected that the ECAA Agreement will be signed under the Austrian presidency and will enter into force soon after.
The ECAA will rest on 2 inseparable pillars:
1) Aligning aviation standards and regulations in Europe on safety, security, competition policy, social policy and consumer rights.
The harmonisation of laws with EU legislation illustrates the willingness of the South East European countries to share the European Union’s values and principles.
As aviation plays an important role in connecting people and economies, the ECAA will also help to prepare candidate countries in the region for EU membership.
The level of regulatory convergence is unprecedented, as all 8 ECAA partners have accepted to align their national aviation legislation to the complete set of EU legislation on aviation.
2) Opening up market opportunities for the aviation industry on both sides by creating a single market for aviation consisting of 35 countries and more than 500 million people i.e.
52 million additional people to the EU market.
Air traffic between the EU and South-East Europe has seen significant growth recently, 121% growth since 2001, and this trend will be accelerated through full integration in a common air transport market.
Forecasts for aircraft movements in the region predict an average annual growth rate of more than 6% per annum between 2005 and 2011.
As a result, affordable air travel will be increasingly accessible to a greater number of people.

(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Sartori's excellent work looks like the best legislative outcome for updating and therefore ensuring better regulation of certain aspects of chemical processing.
The report is praiseworthy not only because it satisfies the UN's harmonisation programme; it seems coherent, addressing the needs of producers and consumers, as well as the environment of course, in so far as this is objectively possible.
As usual, some of my fellow Members are not completely satisfied.
I get the impression that this is due to an ideological radicalisation in the face of technological and scientific progress that all too often, on the pretext of environmental protection, tries to coerce us.
Coincidentally, for completely different reasons to those mentioned, countries outside the European Union, not least China, are putting the economy first by allowing chemicals to be manufactured, transported and stored under conditions that are in serious breach of everything that we quite rightly want to protect here.
The Sartori report is a fundamental step forward, harmonising the classification of substances and the labelling and packaging standards of hazardous substances and mixtures.
Doubtless this will help improve safety and prevent risks to the health and safety of consumers and workers and the environment.
It is currently possible for countries to classify the same substance very differently, according to different classification systems in force, and these differences can be so great as to present a risk.
Substances that in Europe are classified as hazardous may, in countries such as China for example, not carry any warnings on their labels.
Not only does this situation create an unfair competitive advantage, but it is a serious threat to consumers everywhere and this, ladies and gentlemen, although you often criticise it, is unfortunately especially true in a global market.
C omputation of Flash CCI
To compute the flash consumer confidence indicator for the EU and euro area, DG ECFIN uses the data available on the cut-off date.
The estimation procedure combines historical data with information from those Member States for which data are available in the reference month.
Experience has shown this procedure to be statistically reliable.
Further information on the computation procedure can be found in the European Business Cycle Indicators of January 2010.

Over 12 months, in 28 countries1(1), the European Union will be encouraging the promotion of the educational values of sport and reinforcing the links between the worlds of sport and education, demonstrating that, in addition to passion and competition, sport conveys civic values that contribute to a better education.
“The European Year of Education through Sport will be taking place at an exceptional time for the youth of this continent”, said Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Education and Culture, at a press conference in Brussels.
For this reason, the European Union has chosen 2004 to disseminate and explain sporting values to young people in no less than 28 countries.
And I hope that, this year, we will also see sport enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty”.
The decision to name 2004 the “European Year of Education through Sport” was adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council early this year, on the basis of a Commission proposal.
Several European sports stars are endorsing this European Year: great contemporary athletes such as French tennis champion Amélie Mauresmo, and former champions such as Luxembourg skier Marc Girardelli.
Some supporters of the Year attended the press conference, in particular Theresa Zabell, former world sailing champion and now an MEP, Rosa Mota, the Portuguese Olympic marathon champion in 1988, and Hungarian fencing legend Kulcsar Gyözo.
Many sports federations will be supporting the EYES, including the European Olympic Committees, the International School Sport Federation and the International Ski Federation.
They will be joined by the European sports broadcaster, Eurosport.
Other major sporting events in 2004 will also be highlighting the Year, such as the Four Hills Tournament (ski jumping) in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (January), Euro 2004 (June-July) in Portugal and the Olympic Games in Athens (August).
Certain prestigious cultural events, such as the New Year Concert in Vienna, will also be associated with it.
In order to arrange events associated with the Year, the European Commission launched in May of this year a call for proposals for the selection of transnational projects for the first six months of 2004.
At the press conference, Viviane Reding presented the logo which will be used for all the events during the Year.
This logo, created by the Berlin student Julia Kotulla, was selected by a panel of design and marketing experts from 600 submissions received during the summer from 27 countries.
The same day, the European Commission will be publishing a Eurobarometer survey on sport and education.
The official launch of the Year will take place next January and will be one of the key events at the start of the Irish Presidency.
A national coordination body has been designated in each participating country in order to oversee the Year as it unfolds.

The motion for a resolution on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security is a much needed and timely document, as it has appeared just when an increasingly rapid rise is being noted in the prices of a large number of food products.
The recommendations contained in the report are realistic and relevant, addressing real issues in this area.
I would like to mention the importance attached to training and encouraging new generations of farmers in the EU, which is vital in the context of an ageing population.
I also want to mention the focus on maintaining the diversity of agriculture within the Union so as to give a further chance to traditional agriculture as well.
.   Mr President, I should like to start by saying that Mr Zīle and Mr El Khadraoui have both tabled excellent reports, for which I should like to thank them.
The fact that we are considering these reports together is also good news, since it will give an idea of our policy on civil aviation in general, and in particular with regard to China and Russia.
The latter are key countries in economic, political and population terms, and also countries where aviation is developing at a very fast pace.
The report tabled by Mr El Khadraoui provides us with a basis for a common EU aviation policy towards the rest of the world.
This will place the EU in a stronger position, and my group very much welcomes this approach.
Mr Zīle stressed in his report that the Committee on Transport and Tourism did not have access to the negotiating mandate beforehand, and I can assure the Commissioner that the Commission will be asked to be more open towards Parliament as far as negotiating mandates are concerned.
We believe that the position on Russia outlined in Parliament’s report is ‘friendly but firm’, and I am delighted that the Commissioner too has expressed his support for such an approach.
We agree entirely with the demands made regarding service quality standards, environmental protection, technical equipment for airports and air traffic control, including safety issues.
We are fundamentally opposed to charges for flights over Siberia, and we believe that this issue should be resolved along with the other matters that will be negotiated with Russia.
We would stress that the principle of mutuality needs to be observed, in relations with both Russia and China.
This holds particularly true when it comes to debates on the rules ensuring a common level playing field for competition in the field of aviation for the EU Member States, and also for Russian and Chinese operators.
I am therefore very much in favour of these two reports being adopted, and the rapporteurs deserve our thanks for their work.
I am also delighted that the positions of the Commission, the Commissioner and Parliament coincide in a great many respects.
You are right, Mr Speroni.
I agree.
With these introductory words, we in the European Parliament also refer to events of this kind which are happening throughout the world.
We remember all victims with great pain.
We also sympathise with the victims' families and friends, and with the countries where these things happen.
However, this was an exceptional case, because such things have not happened in Russia itself for a long time.
This is why I mentioned it.
However, you are absolutely right, Mr Speroni.
We should remember that every week, throughout the world, there are many very depressing cases of this kind.
This is why our work in Europe, in the European Union, makes so much sense, and this is why we can be glad that it has been possible to solve many of these problems in our Europe, although we still have not solved them all.
Thank you, Mr Speroni, for pointing this out to me.
Thank you very much.
Brussels, 16 December 2010
After 9 months of negotiations, the European Parliament confirmed today the agreement with the Council on the new regulation on implementing powers for the Commission.
This new regulation, proposed by the Commission shortly after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, means a wide ranging reform of the so-called 'comitology' system.
“The negotiations have not always been easy, but our main objectives have been met.
The new rules establish a system of control by Member States of the implementing powers given to the Commission which will be simpler, more efficient, more transparent and in full compliance with the Treaty”.
The Treaty of Lisbon foresees two kinds of powers to the Commission: delegated powers for quasi-legislative measures, and implementing powers.
In the past, all these acts were submitted to so-called comitology procedures.
In some specific cases there might be a need to go to an "appeal committee", but this is just a "normal" committee, chaired by the Commission, albeit of a higher level of representation.
It provides the opportunity to reconsider the draft measures or to r make changes if need be.
Moreover, the regulation foresees that implementing measures in policy areas such as trade defence measures will be included in the normal regime.
Until now these measures were submitted to special procedures in which the Council frequently had the last word.
The new regulation simplifies existing procedures and it will begin to apply to all existing legislation from "day one".
The new procedures also give more flexibility to the Commission and a greater political responsibility.
In the absence of a qualified majority against or in favour of a Commission draft implementing act, the Commission will have the choice between adopting the act or reviewing it.
The Commission regrets this exception to the normal rules.
However, most trade defence measures, such as anti-dumping and countervailing definitive measures, will be submitted to the new standard rules.
These will help to avoid the politicisation of the process, leave less room for lobbying by any party or by third countries, and ensure a more robust trade defence policy.
All comitology procedures will be conducted in full transparency: all documents submitted to the committees are simultaneously disclosed to the European Parliament and to the Council.
In such a case, the Commission will review the draft measure in question and will explain to the European Parliament and the Council what it intends to do.
The Commission welcomes the agreement as a very sound basis for the correct implementation of EU law, and a welcome improvement for transparent and efficient decision making.
Crisis distillation of wine to be opened in Spain and Greece
The Wine Management Committee voted today on proposals from the European Commission to open crisis distillation of wine in Spain and Greece.
Commenting on the opening of distillation Mariann Fischer Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural development, said: "
What’s worse, both countries are distilling ‘quality’ wine.
This is exactly why we are calling for an urgent and profound reform of our wine market.”
Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the wine markets in different Member States resulting in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks.
Today, crisis distillation has also been opened for Spain and Greece.
The price paid for the wine to be distilled is € 1.914 per %vol and per hl for table wine and € 3.00 per % vol per hl for quality wine.
http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/wine/index_en.htm
rapporteur. - Madam President, I very much welcome the Commissioner's positive response.
I think some of the things he has talked about will be extremely useful - the Fundamental Rights Agency, guidance on ethnic profiling, the Commission working with the Council of Europe on its recommendation, and the suggestion that the Article 29 Working Party can be asked for guidance.
I would like to push the Commission a little bit further, though, on focusing on the specific problems of profiling.
After all, we do have a recommendation on the table for profiling in the context of PNR data, so there are special problems.
I would like to thank very warmly the small but select band of colleagues who have contributed to the debate.
I think two things came out strongly: first of all, the fact that so-called 'security' measures can create insecurity and, secondly, that they can be a waste, instead of a targeting, of resources.
So we are talking here about effectiveness as well as civil liberties.
Madam President, first, may I declare an interest?
I am an egg producer.
Regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard.
That is essential.
An EU-inspired crisis will shortly hit the UK egg industry.
From 1 January 2012, the production of eggs in battery cages is banned.
The ban does not apply to eggs from Romania or Bulgaria, and perhaps others, who have a temporary immunity under their accession treaties.
As long as they are processed, these countries may legally export battery-cage eggs produced after the ban to the UK.
UK egg producers who have invested very heavily in alternative systems will be expected to compete at a disadvantage against imported products which can be produced far more cheaply.
I must insist first that these imported products are clearly labelled and secondly, and most importantly, that we introduce with immediate effect an additional number 'four', for eggs produced using colony systems.
Only then can consumers make an informed choice.
To wind up the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00.

Zimbabwe’s Outlaw Regime
PARIS – On July 20, the Zimbabwean authorities arrested the internationally renowned investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and charged him with “incitement to participate in public violence.”
But Chin’ono’s real crime was to expose – in collaboration with Mduduzi Mathuthu, another journalist now facing arrest – alleged procurement fraud at the health ministry involving COVID-19 medical supplies.
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year. From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
Chin’ono’s revelations led a reluctant Emmerson Mnangagwa, the country’s president, to eventually fire health minister Obadiah Moyo.
But whereas Moyo was granted bail following his arrest, Chin’ono remains in detention awaiting trial.
After Chin’ono was arrested, Magistrate Judith Taruvinga signed an overly broad warrant allowing the authorities to search his home for “illegal documents and other articles kept at the house.”
About 30 armed police, brandishing an additional warrant, later raided Chin’ono’s home and seized his camera.
By contrast, Moyo was subject to no such raids or searches.
By arresting a prominent corruption-busting reporter, the Zimbabwean government has once again demonstrated its intention to use the law as a political weapon to criminalize journalism.
Finally, the international community is seeing behind Mnangagwa’s lofty rhetoric and recognizing the true nature of his regime.
For all his attempts to burnish his government’s international image, Mnangagwa is simply following the authoritarian playbook of his longtime predecessor, Robert Mugabe.
This should come as no surprise: Mnangagwa had been Mugabe’s special security assistant for 40 years before becoming president following the 2017 military coup that deposed his mentor.
When Mnangagwa began what he unabashedly calls his “reign,” an international community exhausted by Mugabe’s villainy was hankering for rapprochement and partnership.
Investors envisaged a new era in which the authorities would implement predictable rules, clean up pervasive corruption, and rein in rent-seeking officialdom.
Mnangagwa played along, declaring that Zimbabwe was “open for business.”
Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more – All for less than $9 a month.
Just over two years later, however, Mnangagwa’s pretense has fallen apart. Matching Mugabe’s cruelty and entitlement, but lacking his erstwhile patron’s eloquence and intelligence, Mnangagwa has revealed himself to be a clueless buffoon with a cartoonish sense of his own invincibility.
The world can now see clearly what was always obvious to discerning Zimbabweans: the 2017 coup was no act of self-renewal by the ruling ZANU-PF party, but rather stemmed from the impatience of a political heir eager for his own turn to maim, steal, and kill.
After all, how can the regime claim to be open for business following its treatment of Chin’ono, whose exposé alleged that Mnangagwa’s son was connected to the procurement scandal?
What “second republic” and “new dispensation” bombast can still sound meaningful after government security agents’ recent abduction and sexual assault of three young female opposition leaders, who were then arrested for supposedly faking the episode?
What posturing about political reforms can be sustained when the regime, continuing where Mugabe left off, has gunned down peaceful demonstrators, manipulated elections, and committed torture and other crimes under international law?
The regime knows that charging Chin’ono with inciting public violence is legal hot air, so it is punishing him through pretrial travesties.
As Amnesty International’s Deprose Muchena has observed, Chin’ono’s arrest and detention are part of a broader attempt by the Zimbabwean authorities to persecute the regime’s critics.
Recently, for example, Zimbabwe’s chief justice issued judges with a directive requiring that their judgments be “seen and approved” by their superiors before being issued – a patently unconstitutional instruction, given that judges must be independent.
Although the chief justice dropped the word “approved” the following day, and later, following an outcry, seemed to withdraw the entire directive, the purpose remains clear.
In addition, human-rights lawyers have recently been arrested on spurious charges.
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe’s woes continue to multiply.
Alex Magaisa, a lawyer, recently described how extensive official looting of a state-run agricultural support scheme had resulted in massive public debt.
This followed earlier revelations by the opposition MP Tendai Biti that billions of dollars had been diverted from a separate “command agriculture” program.
With nurses striking in a collapsed health-care system, and parts of the country’s hungry population calling for mass protests, the regime is in full panic mode.
The arrest on July 31 of several peaceful protesters, including internationally renowned writer Tsitsi Dangarembga and student Panashe Sivindani, rounded off a month of citizen discontent, during which Mnangagwa also announced stricter COVID-19 lockdown measures for an indefinite period.
Even in a context of rising infections, the draconian rules prompted the United Nations to express concern about a possible authoritarian clampdown.
The new directives impose a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., and require all “non-working” Zimbabweans to stay at home during the day – at a time when formal unemployment is above 90%.
The Zimbabwean regime thrives on graft and lies.
Mnangagwa uses the law and institutions of justice not as the testaments they should be to the ideals of belonging, fairness and dignity, but as carrots and knobkerries to wield as he sees fit.
Such behavior has now created an environment of lawlessness and injustice that is causing responsible investors to think twice about putting their money in Zimbabwe.
When a regime shoots itself in the foot, as the one in Harare is doing, the foreign investment that comes to the country is typically crudely extractive: blood contracts calculated to hollow out its natural resources in exchange for supporting its rulers with tanks, guns, and ammunition, other tools of political and social repression, and fat personal bank accounts.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I believe the minimum income report that we have voted through in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is the best way forward and will achieve the widest support.
That is why I urge you to reject amendments 1 and 2.
I have always been a passionate supporter of a minimum income in all Member States, and I have written it into all the reports I have ever done on social inclusion, but I believe the best way of achieving this is through an exchange of best practice.
In my view, if we try to take the legislative route, we will fail to take everyone with us and will not achieve what we all want - a decent standard of living for all and to take people out of poverty and avoid homelessness.
In the Employment Committee report, we also say that the most effective way out of poverty is to give labour market access to all.
One way of achieving this is to make sure the Employment Directive is implemented effectively across all Member States.
When formulating policy regarding poverty and social inclusion, we must listen to people at the sharp end - in other words, those who are experiencing poverty and homelessness themselves.
We must make sure that Member States meet their targets for poverty reduction as outlined in the EU 2020 strategy.
I would also like to point out in this debate that we are talking about a minimum income - in other words, out-of-work benefits and not wages.
in writing. - (PL) Services account for more than three-quarters of the European economy.
The services sector is of vital importance to the competitiveness and innovation of the European economy, which is largely based on knowledge.
Efficient operation of the European Union's internal market in services is very important for the competitiveness of EU enterprises on the global market.
Timely and appropriate transposition and implementation will be vital to sound operation of the market, especially in the case of the Services Directive.
Trade in services largely involves the transfer of specialised knowledge between countries.
Consequently, free trade in services plays an important part in all development strategies, because it facilitates swift and effective transfer of know-how on a large scale.
In addition, increasing access to the market in services represents an opportunity not only for developed countries but also for developing ones, which are often deprived of access to know-how.
Access to the market for services is a difficult issue in the context of the ongoing negotiations at the WTO.
It should be borne in mind, however, that negotiations on trade in services must serve the interests of the EU as well as promoting the development of the poorest countries.
If substantial foreign investment is allowed, it could be precisely the liberalisation of trade in services that might facilitate increased and more sustainable production and the modernisation of infrastructure in all economies.
.
Madam President, I warmly welcome this proposal steered by the Committee on Culture and Education and its Chairman, Mr Sifunakis, for an Olympic truce.
It is true that the Olympic Games have a long tradition going back to Ancient Greece, just as Mr Sifunakis described so well in his speech.
It has also been part of that tradition that, during the Olympics, during those 16 days, there is an attempt to suspend all hostilities and allow nations to come together.
Then nations have also showed, and I hope they will continue to do so, that they can live in peaceful coexistence.
Sport is an excellent tool for this.
We would do well to remember that, unfortunately, we have not always been able to keep the peace during the Olympics.
Europe is well aware of that black day in September 1972 when Palestinian terrorists struck in the Olympic village in Munich.
In all, 16 people were killed, mainly Israelis.
Let this serve as a warning that never again should such an incident occur in international sport and when sports events are taking place.
On the contrary, sport, whose purpose it is to bring people together to compete in a spirit of fair play, should unite nations: this could be that source of wealth, that source of growth, which in the future we act to support.
It has to be said that sport is an excellent way of building a better world.
Now, as we speak of an Olympic truce, the word truce would appear to mean some sort of temporary peace.
Let it be our goal to achieve permanent peace between nations and countries, and let sport be instrumental in building this peace.
(PL) Madam President, there are around 60 000 MS sufferers in Poland, which ranks Poland in third place after Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, in those countries, around 30% of sufferers have access to immunomodulating therapy, whereas in Poland barely over 2% of patients can obtain this treatment.
This is mainly due to a lack of funding and it is a problem that also affects the treatment of many other diseases, including cancer.
MS is currently an incurable disease, resulting from an impaired immune system, which leads to damage of the myelin sheath.
Immunomodulating treatment is expensive, as is physiotherapy.
In Poland, any resolutions passed are not implemented mainly due to economic reasons and the crisis in the health service, the transformation of which has resulted in poor organisation and privatisation.
The costs of medicines produced by Western companies are also prohibitively high.
In my opinion, the European Parliament could try to influence these companies to prevent them from exploiting poorer patients and taking away their basic human right, namely the right to protect their health and to have access to medical treatment.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international trade and exports are an important source of growth and employment in Europe.
The Free Trade Agreement that we are debating today will strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union and will provide our enterprises with significantly better access to a highly dynamic region of growth.
Both the European and the Korean economy will benefit considerably.
Our gross domestic product will increase.
That could lead to the creation of new jobs.
Our exports to Korea will double in the next few years according to all the forecasts because duties and non-tariff barriers to trade will be abolished; the relief in terms of duties alone will amount to EUR 1.6 billion per year.
For the European Union there will be a substantial new trade in goods and services with a value of up to EUR 19 billion.
I am particularly pleased that, in the negotiations, the Commission took full account of the negotiation recommendations expressed by the European Parliament in the Martin Report from 2008.
I am also pleased that the European Commission took account both of the concerns expressed by Parliament and also of those coming from industry and it was also able to dispel some concerns just in the last few weeks.
Something that I have never experienced before in the area of foreign trade is positive feedback even coming from the agricultural sector, which is usually more likely to be a problem for us in the area of trade negotiations.
In the area of agriculture, the agreement will facilitate access to South Korea for European agricultural products from 1 July 2011.
Up to now, only 2% of our agricultural products reach the South Korean market duty free.
For pork, annual duties amounting to EUR 240 million are paid, and for milk and milk products the figure is around EUR 100 million.
All of these barriers to market access for our domestic agriculture will now be removed.
I would be pleased if, for this area in particular, the European Commission would consider how we could set up some kind of market access programme, not only for small and medium-sized enterprises, but also for agriculture in the countries that will profit from the Free Trade Agreement.
Above all, I would be pleased if we were also to ensure that our partners in South Korea now actually implement the trade facilitation measures promised in the agreement.
I call for it to be clearly monitored whether new barriers to trade are introduced, and I would, in particular, like to congratulate the Commission.
What the Commission has achieved and what Parliament's rapporteurs have achieved, particularly in the trialogue negotiations, is an example to us all.
I hope that we will have a broad majority in favour of this agreement in this House tomorrow.
. I do indeed endorse unreservedly the draft European Constitution, and it was with enthusiasm that I voted in favour of my colleagues’ excellent report.
This draft is no doubt a compromise but it also represents a considerable advance.
The Union of 25 will be stabilised by having a President appointed for two and a half years instead of a presidency that rotates every six months.
A Minister of Foreign Affairs will be Europe’s voice in the world.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights has at last been incorporated into the institutional framework.
The citizens enjoy the right of petition (capable of being translated into European law with the support of over 1 million signatures), and, in the social sphere, for the first time, the Union sets itself targets for shared progress in a social market economy.
In short, the European Union is becoming more democratic, more transparent, clearer and more effective.
It may be, though, that the hardest task awaits us yet: to complete ratification in all our Member States, and hence to explain it in such a way as to persuade Europe’s citizens.
I am also delighted that, in this nervous time for Europe, a recent survey reveals that the Belgian public are ready to go into battle for a ‘yes’ to the Constitutional Treaty; 80% of them are in favour of it!
Better protection for victims of domestic violence under new EU law adopted today
Victims of violence, in particular domestic violence, will soon be able to count on EU-wide protection, following today's adoption of a European Commission proposal by Justice Ministers from the EU Member States.
Practically this means that restraining orders issued in one EU country will have to be recognised across the entire EU.
In this way, the protection will travel with the individual.
The EU law will benefit women in particular: around one in five women in Europe have suffered physical violence at least once in their life, according to surveys.
"The European Protection Order adopted today will help to protect victims of crime and victims of violence, wherever they go in Europe: the protection will travel with the citizen.
“I would like to thank Justice Ministers and the European Parliament for their support in bringing the Commission’s proposal quickly to life.
Victims deserve nothing less than being treated with respect and getting the protection they need.
I count on Member States to translate the European Protection Order and the Directive on victims' rights adopted last year swiftly into reality for our citizens. ”
The Commission proposed the Regulation as part of a package of measures to improve victims’ rights (see IP/11/585 and MEMO/11/310 ).
The Victims Directive – which sets out minimum rights for crime victims wherever they are in the EU – is already in the European statute book (IP/12/1200 ).
Today's vote is a major step towards closing protection gaps for victims of domestic violence who want to exercise their right to free movement in the EU.
Denmark will not be participating.
Background
This included a proposal for a Regulation on mutual recognition of civil law protection measures.
It will ensure that:
victims are treated with respect and police, prosecutors and judges are trained to properly deal with them;
victims get information on their rights and their case in a way they understand;
victim support exists in every Member State;
victims can participate in proceedings if they want and are helped to attend the trial;
vulnerable victims are identified – such as children, victims of rape, or those with disabilities – and are properly protected;
victims are protected while police investigate the crime and during court proceedings.
Member States now have three years to implement the provisions of the Directive into their national laws.
Up to 15% of the EU population may fall victim of a crime somewhere in the EU every year.
The risk of being a victim is just as great when travelling abroad as it is at home.
Minimum rules for victims are part of the EU's broader objective to build a European area of justice, so that people can rely on the same level of basic rights and have confidence in the justice system wherever they are in the EU.

The Time Has Come for a Global Carbon Emissions Tax
STOCKHOLM – The problem is staggering, even existential.
Global emissions of greenhouse gases – especially carbon dioxide – are rapidly driving up global temperatures, transforming life as we know it.
If those temperatures reach 2oC above pre-industrial levels, scientists warn, the results will be catastrophic.
An international conference is called, under the auspices of the United Nations.
Politicians declare that the world must curb CO2 emissions to avoid exceeding the 2oC threshold.
And then nothing substantial happens.
Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
The 2015 UN climate conference in Paris was supposed to be different.
It produced a document, signed by 197 parties, containing general guidelines for climate policy and memorializing a global commitment finally to address the problem.
As usual, however, emissions have continued to rise steadily, increasing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 at an alarming rate.
Last year’s climate conference in Katowice, Poland – which focused on making the Paris commitments more specific and binding – did nothing to change this.
The reason UN climate conferences keep failing is straightforward: their agendas – centered on voluntary, quantitative targets – are fundamentally flawed.
Agreeing to quantitative, universally applied emissions-reduction targets at a UN conference is easy.
But countries automatically regard adherence to those targets as a sacrifice: in the effort to reduce emissions by x tons, we would lose y million jobs, and GDP will fall by $z billion.
Because there are no actual sanctions or punishment for non-compliance, when push comes to shove, governments can simply change their minds.
Even if a government does try to uphold its commitments, say, by imposing new regulations on high-emitting industries, it may not obtain the desired results.
Businesses, too, want to avoid making any sacrifices, so they will seek any way to avoid regulations, including bribing government officials to look the other way.
Questions of fairness can further weaken incentives to fulfill UN climate commitments.
Why should a poor developing country make the same reduction, whether in absolute or proportional terms, as a rich Western country?
After all, on their path to high-income status, Western economies emitted with abandon.
Poor countries not only face constraints on development that their rich counterparts never did; it is also much harder for them to cover the costs of creating a low-carbon economy.
Compensation is discussed, but countries consistently fail to agree on who should receive how much support, and who should pay.
So the debate is pushed to the next conference.
Meanwhile, the volume of atmospheric CO2 keeps increasing.
The voluntary quantitative restrictions that underpin the UN climate agenda amount to a weak foundation for a solution to the crisis.
A better approach would begin with a uniform tax on CO2 emissions worldwide – say, $100 per ton.
Virtually all economists agree that, from an economic perspective, such a tax would create a much firmer foundation for climate action, not least because it would generate immediate revenues for governments.
A global tax would also be politically more feasible than national measures – such as the French fuel tax that triggered widespread protests against President Emmanuel Macron – because consumers would not bear the full cost.
To be sure, prices for consumers would still rise, with the precise amount depending on the price sensitivity of supply and demand.
If the supply of oil were completely inelastic (that is, if the world had a fixed number of wells from which oil could be pumped at no cost), the market price would fall by exactly the amount of the tax.
In such a scenario, the full cost of the tax would be borne by the owners of the oil wells.
But supply is not completely inelastic.
If the market price is high, new oil deposits (with higher extraction costs) will be developed; if it is low, some existing production will be closed down.
The extent to which oil companies adjust to shifting demand will thus shape the effect of a global CO2 tax on consumer prices.
Because supply is not completely elastic, either, producers and consumers would share the burden of the CO2 tax, meaning that both would have an incentive to reduce their fossil-fuel production and use – and thus their emissions.
If the billions of dollars in new tax revenue, at least partly funded by oil producers, were channeled toward broadly beneficial or otherwise popular investments, voters might be more than accepting of a CO2 tax.
A CO2 tax would also go a long way toward resolving the corruption problem raised by quantitative emissions restrictions, because governments would have less incentive to accept bribes from companies, especially if officials are held accountable for meeting revenue targets.
Even governments that are skeptical about climate change might find the added revenues sufficiently appealing to support the tax.
In this sense, a CO2 tax is “incentive compatible”: all governments – corrupt or honest, dictatorial or democratic, climate skeptic or climate leader – have a motive to impose and enforce it (provided that all other countries do the same).
As for fairness, the issue would be resolved in an ad hoc way: all oil-consuming countries, rich or poor, would receive tax revenue that is partly covered by oil-producing countries, which include the richest (and, in some cases, most corrupt) economies in the world.
This might not be the optimal way of redistributing wealth across countries, but it is a feasible one.
And the inclusion of any element of redistribution could ease resistance to climate action among developing countries frustrated by the advantages enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts.
The next UN climate conference will take place in Santiago, Chile, in December.
That gives the world eight months to prepare a new agenda focused on coordinating a worldwide CO2 tax.
Oil-producing countries will vote against it, because it would be much harder to avoid implementing than current commitments.
But if most of the international community stands behind the measure, a UN conference could, at long last, bring genuine progress toward reducing global emissions and curbing climate change.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Wortmann-Kool is wrong in two respects.
Firstly, we definitely do not want Mr Daul's farm to burn down.
We do not want any farm to burn down. We want to take precautions, that is our objective.
Secondly, we very much support the measures that Mr Rehn has proposed. It is simply that in some cases, they do not go far enough, because the majority of the measures have only been suggested when Mr Daul's farm is already on fire.
You rightly say that we must prevent the farm from catching fire in the first place and that is the decisive point which I would like to discuss.
Mr López Garrido said today that it had taken an infuriatingly long time for the decisions to be reached. It is also the case that we have spent an infuriatingly long time taking note of the changes that have happened in the European Union over the last ten years.
Mr Rehn has correctly pointed out that differences between the individual euro countries with regard to competitiveness have increased and not decreased.
What you do not mention, Mr Rehn, is something that is very important to us, namely, the fact that the gap between the rich and the poor in Europe is widening.
If that sounds like Marxism to Mr Verhofstadt, to us it is a question of social security and social policy.
However, that is simply not of interest to some people.
The question is how you intend to get people to accept the economic measures and the strict budgetary requirements which you rightly propose when people begin to realise that Europe and the euro area are characterised by a growing gap between rich and poor.
This is unacceptable and this is why there are more protests against the necessary measures than would normally be the case.
Therefore, we are calling on the Commission and the Council to act. We must reduce the differences in competitiveness.
I believe you are absolutely right when you say that we must succeed in increasing the competitiveness of countries such as Greece and Spain.
This is not about making the competition conditions worse in Germany, Holland, Austria or other countries, but about improving the competition conditions in the economically weaker countries.
That is absolutely the right strategy, but your proposal, Mr Rehn, does not include any specific measures for bringing this about.
You spoke today about the reform of the labour market and the pension system.
This is the right approach, but it is not enough just to reform the labour market and pensions. We must also look at the budget.
If we do not develop our infrastructure and if we do not use all the means at our disposal in the Europe 2020 strategy, including green technologies and so on, we will not succeed in achieving this objective.
Therefore, I am asking you to take note of the fact that competitiveness and social security in Europe must be strengthened.
in writing. - (PL) The success of micro-credits in reducing poverty in developing countries, particularly in Southern Asia and Latin America, has not yet taken hold in the EU.
However, the need for micro-credits is great, especially among people unable to take out loans in the traditional banking sector.
Micro-credits as a business differ from traditional banking.
They are granted not just on financial grounds, and not simply for profit, but also help promote cohesion by attempting to integrate people who find themselves in unfavourable circumstances, and want to set up a micro-enterprise.
A successful European initiative to develop micro-credits could help to achieve the aims of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment and help to make the European economy more innovative, creative and dynamic.
In particular, they can help to implement the priority of releasing economic potential by supporting integration, or repeated social and economic integration of people through self-employment.
That is why I support the motion of the rapporteur, who is asking us to adopt appropriate national institutional, legal and commercial frameworks to promote a more favourable environment for the development of micro-credits and to establish a harmonised European framework for non-banking micro-finance institutions.

Environment: Commission takes action against Sweden and Austria over missing industrial permits
Fifty of these plants are in Sweden, and 21 in Austria.
Permits are only issued if a number of environmental criteria are met.
Missing permits
The Commission previously has already sent similar warnings in the case of twelve other Member States.
If Sweden fails to act, a court summons could follow.
Eighteen are in upper Austria, one in Vorarlberg and two in Styria.
For five installations, Austria has been unable to give any clear indication of when the permits might be issued.
IPPC Directive
Under European law, industrial and agricultural activities with a high pollution potential must be licensed.
Legal Process
The Commission has the power to take legal action against a Member State that is not respecting its obligations under Community law, under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The infringement procedure begins with a first written warning ("Letter of Formal Notice") to the Member State concerned, which must be answered within two months.
A failure to act on the final written warning can result in a summons to the Court of Justice.
If the Court rules against the Member State, it must then take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment.
For current statistics on infringements in general, see:
http://ec.europa.eu/community_law/infringements/infringements_en.htm

The European Union welcomes the adoption by the Bolivian Congress of the law calling a referendum on the new political constitution of the State.
The European Union congratulates the Bolivian government as well as all the parties involved on the quality of the work they have accomplished.
The European Union accordingly hopes that the elections planned for 2009 will take place in optimum conditions of transparency and participation.
It considers that the presence of the observers had a positive impact on those processes and reiterates its willingness to continue its involvement.
What effect might the adoption of conflicting national measures on the taxation of passenger air traffic have on the internal market, and what steps can be taken to harmonise those measures?
Although Brazilian citizens can travel to all EU Member States without having to obtain a visa, in the case of a short stay, there are, however, four EU Member States - Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia - whose citizens require a visa in order to enter Brazilian territory.
Although all the other Member States have negotiated bilateral agreements with Brazil so as to ensure a short-stay visa waiver, at present, however, it is no longer possible for the Member States to conclude this type of agreement on an individual basis.
Thus, the EU has an exclusive external remit in the field of the common visa policy.
On 8 November 2010, an agreement was therefore concluded between the EU and Brazil, granting a reciprocal visa waiver for travel for the purpose of tourism and business for all Brazilian and EU citizens.
I support the fact that this agreement thus ensures equal treatment for all EU citizens, ensuring that it can only be suspended or terminated, whether by Brazil or by the EU, if it is applied to all its Member States.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the European Union is fully committed to the success of the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries, which will take place in Istanbul on 9-13 May 2011.
It believes that this conference provides a major opportunity to enhance support for the least developed countries (LDCs).
The Council has very recently adopted conclusions to be used as guidelines by the EU negotiators in the preparatory process and during the conference.
Prioritising LDCs is a necessity in our common endeavour to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
We therefore remain firmly committed to supporting the inclusive and sustainable development of all LDCs, which represent the poorest and weakest segment of the international community, and which are also characterised by their acute susceptibility to external economic shocks, natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases.
We strongly support an outcome focusing on areas and measures that can add value with regard to the specific needs of LDCs and which should reflect the lessons learned from the 2001 Brussels Programme of Action, by maintaining coherence with the MDGs and setting specific goals and targets for LDCs.
A long-term commitment through a renewed partnership with LDCs containing suitable measures is fundamental in a rapidly changing world.
In particular, the European Union considers that the outcome of the Istanbul conference should address three main objectives: firstly, combating the vulnerability and fragility of LDCs and further enhancing their resilience to shocks; secondly, creating a favourable environment for the sustainable development of LDCs; thirdly, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth for LDCs.
These objectives will continue to guide the European Union's discussions with the LDCs throughout the preparatory process and during the conference itself.
The European Union has always led the international community's efforts to support the LDCs, and is their largest donor.
It has been the most successful development partner at fulfilling its commitments, notably in terms of market access, rules of origin and debt alleviation.
It has made significant progress on official development assistance (ODA) as well as on policy coherence for development.
Some LDCs have achieved good economic growth and progress in development during the last decade, yet we recognise that overall, progress has been uneven.
Considerable work remains to be done, notably in sub-Saharan Africa and in countries that are in both conflict and fragile situations.
For that reason, the EU has recently reaffirmed its commitment, in the context of the overall ODA commitment, to meet collectively the target of providing 0.15-0.20 of GNP to the LDCs.
The LDCs have primary responsibility for their own development, and assistance by the donor community ought to be based on the initiative and full ownership of the recipient countries.
The European Union also stresses the interdependence of overall progress in the LDCs with the improvement of good governance, democracy, human rights and gender equality.
Finally, at the same time, we are firmly convinced that all countries have the responsibility to help developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty and achieve progress towards the MDGs.
Progress in the LDCs is interconnected with the quality and coherence of development partner policies.
Strong efforts should therefore be directed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of aid mechanisms and to fulfilling existing commitments.
On several occasions, the EU has called on other donors to meet these commitments.
Emerging economies should also provide their fair share of assistance to LDCs.
Mr President, the topic of the report is doubly sensitive, both politically and economically.
On the one hand, the EU wants to prevent dual-used goods to be used for military purposes and/or against people.
On the other hand, it has to consider the economic interests of producers and users.
The regulation is therefore inevitably bushy, having to cover for both existing intentional loopholes and anticipate for others in the future.
Moreover, while for some, the regulation would appear too strong, for others it would appear too weak, requiring constant revision.
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I fully support the need for a more transparent and stricter regulation.
I am therefore totally in favour of authorisation before export and not vice versa.
Particularly after Lisbon, Parliament can only help, and this is exactly what it is doing here and now.
Consequently, its role should be strengthened, not overlooked.

Who is not considered to be an early school leaver?
The Europe 2020 strategy contains five headline targets.
One is to reduce the EU average early school leaving rate to less than 10% by 2020.
It impacts directly on the employability of young people and contributes to breaking the cycle of deprivation, social exclusion and poverty.
What are the economic and social costs of early school leaving?
Young people with only lower secondary education or less are more often affected by unemployment, are more likely to depend on social benefits and have a higher risk of social exclusion.
It affects their lifetime earnings, well-being and health.
They tend to participate less in democratic processes.
Early school leaving has long-term negative effects on social development and economic growth.
Innovation and growth rely on a skilled labour force: Reducing the average European rate of early school leaving by just 1 percentage point would provide the European economy each year with nearly half a million additional qualified potential young employees.
Why do young people abandon education early?
There are many reasons why some young people give up education and training prematurely.
Although the situation varies in different countries, early school leaving in Europe is strongly linked to social disadvantage and low education backgrounds.
It is a process which often starts in primary education with first experiences of failure and alienation from school.
When do the young people concerned typically leave education?
This latter group is especially large in Bulgaria (38%) and Portugal (40%).
What do early school leavers do?
In 2009, only 48% of early school leavers in the EU were in employment, while 52% were either unemployed or outside the labour market.
The percentage of young people who had abandoned education but were in employment was highest in Malta (74%), Cyprus (74%), Portugal (71%), and the Netherlands (71%).
Especially large numbers of early school leavers were either unemployed or inactive in Slovakia (80%), in Bulgaria (73%) and in Hungary (71%)
On average across the EU, twice as many young people from the first generation of migrants abandon school early compared to their native peers (26% versus 13%).
But again, we see substantial differences between Member States: In Greece, Spain and Italy more than 40% of young migrants are early school leavers.
A few countries such as Portugal, the UK and Norway show lower rates of early school leavers among migrants compared to natives.
Where does the data come from?
Data are taken from the European Labour Force Survey (LFS), which is conducted in the 27 Member States, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.
It is a large household sample survey providing quarterly results on labour participation of people aged 15 and over as well as on people who are not in employment.
The national statistical institutes are responsible for selecting the sample, preparing the questionnaires, conducting interviews among households, and providing the results to the statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat).

Brussels, 23 October 2007
The European Commission has announced today that it will seek a mandate from European Member States to negotiate a new Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) with major trading partners, including the US, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand.
Such an agreement would strengthen efforts to protect European intellectual property around the world, a key part of the EU's Global Europe trade strategy.
EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said: "
Europe has always been at the forefront of global attempts to protect intellectual property rights and fight counterfeiting.
A new international anti-counterfeiting treaty will strengthen global cooperation and establish new international norms, helping to create a new global gold standard on IPR enforcement."
ACTA would contribute to fighting counterfeiting in three ways:
Building international cooperation leading to harmonised standards and better communication between authorities.
This will build on coordinated anti-counterfeiting work the EU is already doing with large partners like the US.
These standards would then be spread to other countries if they wished to sign up to ACTA.
The EU has proposed transitional mechanisms and technical assistance to help advanced developing countries join the pact in the future.
Establishing common enforcement practices to promote strong intellectual property protection in coordination with right holders and trading partners.
The EU is consistently pushing countries like China to enforce anti-counterfeiting legislation and to toughen the legal penalties for intellectual property theft.
Closer coordination on international benchmarks can reinforce this pressure;
Background
Twenty years ago, counterfeiting might have been regarded as a problem chiefly for the makers of luxury goods.
In the 1980s, 70% of firms affected by counterfeiting were in this sector.
But in 2006, more than 1.6 million counterfeit cosmetics / personal care products and 1.2 million foodstuffs & beverages were seized at the EU's external border, out of a total of 130 million fake objects – an increase of 40% since 2005.
There are also fake airplane parts, electrical appliances and toys.
But most worrying is the booming trade in counterfeit medicines of which more than 2.7 million were intercepted at EU borders in 2006, and which are reckoned to account for almost 10% of world trade in medicines.
Most of these fake drugs are headed for the world’s poorest countries.
A key part of the Global Europe Communication by the European Commission was a commitment to strengthen further efforts to protect and enforce European intellectual property around the world.
Since then, the European Union has been worked with countries like China, Russia and others to stop widespread and systematic piracy of European companies' intellectual assets.
The European Commission is also including strong IPR chapters in all its new generation of Free Trade Agreements with India, Korea, ASEAN and Latin America.

Global Europe and IPR protection
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the word go, the Services Directive has been the project of those wanting to see capitalism without any social safeguards prevail in Europe.
The Directive will goad liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation and also wage and social dumping on an unprecedented scale. Companies will be pleased, but for the majority of people it will be a disaster.
In spite of all the protests and all the opposition, Parliament is to pass this Directive today, and those who stand to gain from it owe particular thanks to those in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who have done their best to throw dust in people's eyes with lies and deceit.
The compromise due to be adopted today is not one that keeps alive the remains of a social Europe.
It is a neoliberal hammer designed to obliterate all social aspects.
Those who support it have to do so with their eyes open.
We shall continue to oppose this neoliberal onslaught.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to endorse the view presented here, on behalf of my group, by Mrs De Keyser.
There is no doubt that there must be no toleration for violation of media freedoms.
We are, certainly, seeing disturbing events in Venezuela.
I think, however, that we should be very careful about forming unequivocal, categorical and final judgments.
In my opinion, we should be given an answer to a fundamental question: the stations which were closed down - were they all closed down for political reasons, or were some of them closed down because, in fact, they did not meet legal requirements?
I think an answer here, and understanding what is pure politics and what is legal fact, would have great significance for the position of our House.
The Poverty of Hillary Clinton
NEW YORK – Hillary Clinton is annoying people again.
Recently, she said in an interview that she and her husband were “dead broke” when they left the White House.
This led to unhelpful headlines such as “Bill Clinton: Hillary Is ‘Not Out of Touch.’”
The gaffe also opened the door for Republican attacks – this being a standard campaign strategy that has dogged wealthy major-party candidates (as they all are) since George H.W. Bush was astonished by a grocery scanner.
You would think that Clinton, the first wife and mother to have a good shot at being America’s next president, would easily pass the “relatability” test.
But last weekend, she did it again, telling The Guardian that, “unlike a lot of people who are truly well off,” she and her husband “pay ordinary income tax,” and that their wealth came only “through dint of hard work.”
Clinton’s supporters are right to worry about her nails-on-blackboard elitism.
Her presumptive candidacy’s trump card is supposed to be her advantage among critically important women voters – the deciding factor for Democrats in national elections.
Had Al Gore maintained her husband’s high margin among women in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996, the Supreme Court would not have decided his 2000 election fight with George W. Bush.
Hillary Clinton has raised millions on the premise that she can restore the Democrats’ traditional advantage.
But most of the women sought as voters are not corporate attorneys or secretaries of state.
The gender gap that has benefited the Democratic Party is attributable mainly to struggling working-class and pink-collar women; someone on Clinton’s staff needs to tell her to stop offending them.
Clinton’s rhetoric, as I wrote in a review of the hagiographic “campaign biography” HRC, often alienates many women because of flaws in how she views and expresses herself and her mission.
For starters, she frames her quest in terms of outdated, unappealing, and irrelevant rhetoric. HRC’s iconography includes all-female pictures of her former staff, as if a single-gender – or single-race – photograph would not affront thoughtful people in 2014.
She also seems to believe that women voters see in her the embodiment of their own struggles and will cheer her on vicariously when, by becoming America’s president, she shatters the last “glass ceiling.”
But American women voters know quite well what their own struggles are: paying the bills, educating their kids, dealing with a degenerated, costly health-care system, and so on.
They are interested in a candidate, male or female, who speaks to their life issues, and are turned off by a woman who assumes that they are just waiting, sheep-like, for a Joan of Arc figure who will serve “lesser” women as what Jungian psychologists call an “ego ideal.”
The term “glass ceiling” is itself elitist, deriving as it does from the corporate struggles of a few professional women.
Most American women are having a hard enough time on the factory floor or the unemployment line or making minimum wage at Wal-Mart; when working-class women hear a former corporate attorney carry on about a glass ceiling, they think not about gender identification but about the class divide that has widened since the term came into vogue in the 1980s.
Yet Clinton keeps telling her angry female constituents – as a campaign message! – that she is a member of the 1%.
Finally, she alienates her potential gender-based voters by being perfect.
Clinton’s advisers confirm that never showing weakness is a key component of her strategy.
This was her approach with the Monica Lewinsky scandal – which is predictably rearing its head again, as Lewinsky has come forward (we can’t know the machinations that may have been behind that timing) to muse on old events.
As one of her advisers told me in a TV debate, Clinton’s approach was not to address any pain that she might have felt, as that would have been “the biggest press conference ever.”
That may be true, but it is bad advice nonetheless.
By never showing weakness or honesty about her own suffering or any imperfection in her life, negative stories and hostility continue to percolate.
If she had held a press conference and said something like, “I feel what anyone would feel at this painful time, and I ask for privacy for myself and my family as we try to get through this,” the scrutiny of her would have ended much sooner, along with the story itself.
But the larger issue concerning Clinton’s perfectionism is what it means for her possible role as leader of the free world.
At a time of ever-increasing income disparity in America, is it not a serious political flaw in any presidential candidate not to know how to speak sensitively about wealth and poverty?
And, given diminishing government transparency in the US and more and more secret law, is it not a serious issue that a presidential candidate will not address his or her mistakes and shortcomings?
Hillary Clinton’s campaign badly miscalculated in 2008, losing the Democratic Party nomination to Barack Obama.
She may well get the nomination in 2016; but when she faces the Republican candidate in the election, she may be in for another rude awakening.
Brussels, 28 April 2005
The updated measures proposed today are based on lessons learned from recent epidemics and new scientific knowledge.
EU Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: “
The current situation in Asia and recent outbreaks of avian flu in the EU has shown us how devastating the social and economic consequences of this disease can be.
The proposal is based on lessons learned from recent epidemics, new scientific knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease, how it spreads and the risks to human health.
However, when they mutate into high pathogenic strains they can cause a devastating epidemic and tend to also infect humans.
The new measures are also more flexible regarding vaccination.
This is very important both for disease control and for trade purposes.
The measures proposed will be managed so that restrictions on the trade in poultry and poultry products from the vaccinated areas can be minimised.
Next steps
The draft Directive adopted by the Commission today will have to be approved by the Council after consultation of the European Parliament.
The Trump Boom?
CAMBRIDGE – After years of hibernation, will the US economy rouse itself for a big comeback over the next couple of years?
With an incoming Republican administration hell-bent on reflating an economy already near full employment, and with promised trade restrictions driving up the price of import-competing goods, and with central-bank independence likely to come under attack, higher inflation – likely exceeding 3% at times – is a near-certainty.
And output growth could surprise as well, possibly reaching 4%, at least temporarily.
Impossible you say?
Not at all.
The economy already seems to be growing at a 3% annual clip.
And even steadfast opponents of President-elect Trump’s economic policies would have to admit they are staunchly pro-business (with the notable exception of trade).
Consider regulation.
Under President Barack Obama, labor regulation expanded significantly, not to mention the dramatic increase in environmental legislation.
And that is not even counting the huge shadow Obamacare casts on the health-care system, which alone accounts for 17% of the economy.
I am certainly not saying that repealing Obama-era regulation will improve the average American’s wellbeing.
Far from it.
But businesses will be ecstatic, maybe enough to start really investing again.
The boost to confidence is already palpable.
Then there is the prospect of a massive stimulus, featuring a huge expansion of badly needed infrastructure spending.
(Trump will presumably bulldoze Congressional opposition to higher deficits.)
Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, economists across the political spectrum have argued for taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to finance productive infrastructure investment, even at the cost of higher debt.
High-return projects pay for themselves.
Far more controversial is Trump’s plan for a massive across-the-board income-tax cut that disproportionately benefits the rich.
True, putting cash in the pockets of rich savers hardly seems as effective as giving cash to poor people who live hand to mouth.
Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, memorably spoke of “Trumped-up trickle-down economics.”
But, Trumped-up or not, tax cuts can be very good for business confidence.
It is hard to know just how much extra debt Trump’s stimulus program will add, but estimates of $5 trillion over ten years – a 25% increase – seem sober.
Many left-wing economics commentators, having insisted for eight years under Obama that there is never any risk to US borrowing, now warn that greater borrowing by the Trump administration will pave the road to financial Armageddon.
Their hypocrisy is breathtaking, even if they are now closer to being right.
Exactly how much Trump’s policies will raise output and inflation is hard to know.
The closer the US economy is to full capacity, the more inflation there will be.
If US productivity really has collapsed as much as many scholars believe, additional stimulus is likely to raise prices a lot more than output; demand will not induce new supply.
On the other hand, if the US economy really does have massive quantities of underutilized and unemployed resources, the effect of Trump’s policies on growth could be considerable.
In Keynesian jargon, there is still a large multiplier on fiscal policy.
It is easy to forget the biggest missing piece of the global recovery is business investment, and if it starts kicking in finally, both output and productivity could begin to rise very sharply.
Those who are deeply wedded to the idea of “secular stagnation” would say high growth under Trump is well-nigh impossible.
But if one believes, as I do, that the slow growth of the last eight years was mainly due to the overhang of debt and fear from the 2008 crisis, then it is not so hard to believe that normalization could be much closer than we realize.
After all, so far virtually every financial crisis has eventually come to an end.
Of course, all of this is an optimistic spin on a Trump economy.
If the new administration proves erratic and incompetent (a real possibility), dejection will quickly overwhelm confidence.
But beware of pundits who are certain that Trump will bring economic catastrophe.
On election eve, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman unequivocally insisted that a Trump victory would lead to a stock-market collapse, with no recovery in sight.
Investors who relied on his insights lost a lot of money.
At the risk of hyperbole, it’s wise to remember that you don’t have to be a nice guy to get the economy going.
In many ways, Germany was as successful as America at using stimulus to lift the economy out of the Great Depression.
Yes, it still could all end very badly.
The world is a risky place.
If global growth collapses, US growth could suffer severely.
Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.
Trump’s Art of the Spin
NEW HAVEN – Blinded by a surging stock market and a 50-year low in the unemployment rate, few dare to challenge the wisdom of US economic policy.
Instant gratification has compromised the rigor of objective and disciplined analysis.
Big mistake.
The toxic combination of ill-timed fiscal stimulus, aggressive imposition of tariffs, and unprecedented attacks on the Federal Reserve demands a far more critical assessment of Trumponomics.
Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
Politicians and pundits can always be counted on to spin the policy debate.
For US President Donald Trump and his supporters, the art of the spin has been taken to a new level.
Apparently, it doesn’t matter that federal deficits have been enlarged by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next decade, or that government debt will reach a post-World War II record of 92% of GDP by 2029.
The tax cuts driving these worrying trends are rationalized as what it takes to “Make America Great Again.”
Nor are tariffs viewed as taxes on consumers or impediments to global supply-chain efficiencies; instead, they are portrayed as “weaponized” negotiating levers to force trading partners to change their treatment of the United States.
And attacks on the Fed’s independence are seen not as threats to the central bank’s dual mandate to maximize employment and ensure price stability, but rather as the president’s exercise of his prerogative to use the bully pulpit as he – and he alone – sees fit.
There are three basic flaws with Trump’s approach to economic policy.
First, there is the disconnect between intent and impact.
The political spin maintains that large corporate tax cuts boost US competitiveness.
But that doesn't mean deficits and debt don’t matter.
Notwithstanding the hollow promises of supply-side economics, revenue-neutral fiscal initiatives that shifted the tax burden from one segment of the economy to another would have come much closer to real reform than the reduction of the overall revenue trajectory has.
Moreover, the enactment of fiscal stimulus in late 2017, when the unemployment rate was then at a cyclical low of 4.1% (headed toward the current 3.6%), added froth to markets and the economy when it was least needed and foreclosed the option of additional stimulus should growth falter.
Similarly, Trump’s tariffs fly in the face of one of the twentieth century’s greatest policy blunders – the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which sparked a 60% plunge in global trade by 1932.
With foreign trade currently accounting for 28% of GDP, versus 11% in 1929, the US, as a debtor country today, is far more vulnerable to trade-related disruptions than it was as a net creditor back then.
Ignoring the cascading stream of direct and retaliatory taxes on consumers and businesses that stem from a tariff war, Trump extols the virtues of tariffs as “a beautiful thing.”
That is painfully reminiscent of the 1928 Republican Party platform, which couched tariffs as “a fundamental and essential principle of the economic life of this nation … and essential for the continued prosperity of the country.”
Trump ignores the lessons of the 1930s at great peril.
The same can be said of Trump’s recent Fed bashing.
The political independence of central banking is widely regarded as the singular breakthrough needed to achieve price stability following the Great Inflation of the 1970s.
In the US, passage of the so-called Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 gave then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker the political cover to squeeze double-digit inflation out of the system through a wrenching monetary tightening.
Had Volcker lacked the freedom to act, he would have been constrained by elected leaders’ political calculus – precisely what Trump is doing in trying to dictate policy to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
The second critical flaw in Trump’s economic-policy package is its failure to appreciate the links between budget deficits, tariffs, and monetary policy.
As the late Martin Feldstein long stressed, to the extent that budget deficits put downward pressure on already depressed domestic saving, larger trade deficits become the means to fill the void with surplus foreign saving.
Denial of these linkages conveniently allows the US to blame China for self-inflicted trade deficits.
But with tariffs likely to divert trade and supply chains from low-cost Chinese producers to higher-cost alternatives, US consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of tax hikes, raising the risk of higher inflation.
The latter possibility, though seemingly remote today, could have important consequences for US monetary policy – provided, of course, the Fed has the political independence to act.
Finally, there are always the lags to keep in mind in assessing the impact of policy.
While low interest rates temper short-term pressures on debt-service costs as budget deficits rise, there is no guarantee that such a trend will persist over the longer term, especially with the already-elevated federal debt overhang projected to increase by about 14 percentage points of GDP over the next ten years.
Similarly, the disruptive effects of tariffs and shifts in monetary policy take about 12-18 months to be fully evident.
So, rather than bask in today’s financial-market euphoria, politicians and investors should be thinking more about the state of the economy in late 2020 – a timeframe that happens to coincide with the upcoming presidential election cycle – in assessing how current policies are likely to play out.
There is nothing remarkable about a US president’s penchant for political spin.
What is glaringly different this time is the lack of any pushback from those who know better.
The National Economic Council, established in the early 1990s as an “honest broker” in the executive branch to convene and coordinate debate on key policy issues, is now basically dysfunctional.
The NEC’s current head, Larry Kudlow, a long-standing advocate of free trade, is squirming to defend Trump’s tariffs and Fed bashing.
The Republican Party, long a champion of trade liberalization, is equally complicit.
Trump’s vindictive bluster has steamrolled economic-policy deliberations – ignoring the lessons of history, rejecting the analytics of modern economics, and undermining the institutional integrity of the policymaking process.
Policy blunders of epic proportion have become the rule, not the exception.
It won’t be nearly as easy to spin the looming consequences.
Brussels, 11 May 2001
Commission calls for a renewed effort to fight poverty on eve of UN Conference to help least developed countries
On the eve of this important event, President Romano Prodi stated: "
Collective global solutions to global problems of under-development are needed now, more than ever.
This UN conference is an appeal to fight unilateralism.
It is an attack on protectionism and on short-term national calculations.
It is a time to assess our relations with the poorest countries on this planet.
It is a call on all developed countries to do more, to do better, and to think about the long-term global consequences of our policies."
The European Union (EU) will reaffirm its strong commitment to poverty reduction and to addressing the specific problems of the LDCs.
It sees the Conference as an opportunity to define common solutions requiring action by all partners.
The Commission, in particular, is convinced that the Conference should focus on some concrete and operational outcomes that will make a real difference to peoples lives in the LDCs.
Hosting the Conference, the EU intends to give a strong political signal about the significance it attaches to the problems of the 48 countries currently defined as "least developed" by the UN.
The EU has therefore a special commitment to the successful outcome of the Conference, that will bring together all the UN member states, as well as partners and actors in the public, private and civil sector.
The Conference is expected to adopt a Global Programme of Action outlining the strategy that the LDCs and the international community commit themselves to pursue in order to address the problems of these countries over the coming years.
European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Poul Nielson, said,
"Our LDC partners have made it clear that they expect much more than charity.
They want opportunities.
They ask for and deserve decency.
This is why Europe's offer to the LDCs goes far beyond development co-operation.
We're offering a comprehensive response to the main problems identified by the LDCs themselves in the areas of trade, debt relief, disease and poverty.
Our overall aim should be to achieve the target set by the UN to reduce by half the number of people living in extreme poverty and who suffer from hunger by 2015."
The package includes the following elements:
Sharpening the focus on aid allocations to the poorest countries.
Social sectors such as education and health will be given top priority;
Supporting LDCs in benefiting from unrestricted market access to the EU.
Following on from the Everything but Arms initiative, the Commission is helping LDCs seize the opportunities offered;
Measures to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
The Commission is committed to using all development, trade and research instruments to contribute to an effective global response.
Particular emphasis is given to the way in which these diseases affect the LDCs and poorest populations;
A €60 million proposal to settle all debt owed by ACP least developed highly indebted poor countries on Special Loans.
The Commission is already by far the biggest contributor to the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative with €1 billion.
Mr Nielson stated,
"For the EU, a successful outcome of the Conference will finally depend on the acceptance by the international community of the fact that the complexity of the problems faced by the LDCs requires a common effort by all partners and by both developed and developing countries."
Background
This will be the first time that the European Union hosts a major UN Conference.
Preparations for the Conference have taken place at country, regional, and global level.
The country meetings have led to the formulation of country-specific programmes of action for each LDC.
The Commission participates actively in all the preparatory activities.
Furthermore, EC delegations in LDCs have contributed to the formulation of country-specific programmes of action for each LDC as a basis for establishing the global programme of action to be adopted at the Conference.
EC delegations in ACP countries have supported financially the national preparation processes.
The Commission is also financing the bulk of the additional costs arising from holding the Conference in Brussels.
This includes funding the organisation of an NGO Forum.
Accordingly, the Commission has allocated € 6 Million on the general budget for 2001 to fund these costs.
On this basis, an agreement was signed with the UN for a subvention of € 4,5 Million to support the UN Conference secretariat in logistical, financial and administrative matters.
Negotiations on the Programme of Action are conducted in a Preparatory Committee holding its sessions at UN Headquarters in New York.

(RO) I am extremely concerned by the events which have occurred recently in the Republic of Moldova.
The most serious of these include human rights violations, arrests, kidnappings, torture, intimidation and the expulsion of journalists.
The will of Moldovan citizens has been undermined by the authorities through the numerous irregularities which can provide arguments to support the assumption that the elections have been rigged.
This includes the supplementary lists, the extra vote papers printed, harassment of the opposition, the ban on access to public television stations and the campaign which the state institutions have run for the Communist Party.
Although there have been many voices during these weeks which have protested at a European and global level, unfortunately, the situation in the Republic of Moldova has not improved.
I hope that during the discussions this week and when the ad-hoc mission goes to the Republic of Moldova, but especially through the resolution which we are expecting at the final session in May, the European Parliament will send out a very clear message that the European Union does not tolerate human rights violations and will openly call for the elections in the Republic of Moldova to be rerun.
How America’s Asian Allies Can Survive Trump
WASHINGTON, DC – Judging by US President Donald Trump’s behavior since his election, and by the explicitly isolationist message of his inaugural address, it seems safe to assume that his administration’s foreign policy will upend many long-held assumptions about America’s role in the world.
This may be particularly distressing to America’s Asian allies.
It is far too soon to say what, exactly, Trump’s presidency will mean for Asia.
The spectrum of possibilities is broad.
Trump may reverse President Barack Obama’s strategic “pivot” toward Asia, leaving the region in chaos.
He may maintain a focus on Asia, but with a more militarized approach.
Or he may join with China to create a kind of G2 of the world’s largest powers.
In any case, it seems clear that after decades of broad continuity – since President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, made their surprise trip to China in 1972 – America’s policy toward China is open to question.
Countries that depend on US security guarantees for their defense – such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia – are highly concerned.
Many Asian countries, through deep and predictable political engagement with the US, have grown accustomed to America’s commitment to their security.
And, in contrast to multilateral security arrangements like NATO, America’s Asian alliances are founded on individual bilateral pacts.
As a result, these countries are particularly vulnerable to Trump’s vicissitudes.
Bilateral alliances maximize the control that a great power can exert over smaller allies, whereas multilateral arrangements distribute power and influence more evenly.
And that is exactly how it works in Asia, with the US at the center of a hub-and-spoke system, with other countries connected only through that center.
That structure, known as a star network, works well for coordinating activity or accumulating resources.
As political scientist Victor Cha argued before the election, changes in regional capabilities, the emergence of new threats and challenges, and the diffusion of connectivity in the twenty-first century argue for a new, more multilateral security structure in Asia.
Trump’s suspicion of multilateral institutions – and his unwillingness to absorb the costs of persuasion, side payments, and organization that centralized leadership demands – makes that shift all the more pressing.
Instead of falling into despair, America’s Asian allies should take matters into their own hands and start networking.
By building and institutionalizing ties among themselves, US allies in Asia can reshape their regional security network from a US-centric star to a mesh-like pattern, in which they are as connected to one another as they are to the US.
Such a system can strengthen stability for unsteady times, in three vital ways.
First, if the US falls short on meeting its regional commitments – for example, to engage in capacity building with partners confronting China’s aggressive assertion of territorial claims in the South China Sea – networked partnerships can help allies to compensate.
Already, Japan, Australia, and South Korea provide security assistance to Southeast Asian countries on a bilateral basis.
A multilateral coordination mechanism would enable these countries to harmonize their efforts, thereby boosting their capacity to advance their shared security interests, even if US resources and leadership dwindle.
Moreover, if allies in Asia are skeptical of US intentions, networked partnerships can give them the leverage to demand greater transparency.
The US regularly discusses sensitive defense and human-rights issues relating to North Korea with its allies in Japan and South Korea, but only separately.
That leaves these countries dependent on the US for both information and capabilities.
By grappling with North Korea in a trilateral setting, however, South Korea and Japan could triangulate the information they receive from the US and increase their agency in formulating a response.
Their recent GSOMIA intelligence-sharing agreement is a meaningful step to promote such transparency through networking.
Similarly, such a networked approach could put Asian countries in a much stronger position to restrain the US if the Trump administration took destabilizing actions in the region, such as by exacerbating tensions with China.
Already, Trump has raised doubts about his commitment to the “one China” policy – including by accepting a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president after the election – and threatened to impose high tariffs on China, which he has accused (wrongly) of devaluing its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.
If Trump continues along this path, China has declared, it will respond in kind.
None of this would be good for US allies.
Of course, if one of America’s relatively small allies tried to confront the US over its actions, it would face high costs and a low chance of success.
But if multiple allies worked together, through international institutions and multilateral dialogue, they might be able to persuade Trump’s administration to change course, without harming their own vital interests.
The good news is that America’s Asian allies would not have to start from scratch.
Over the last several years, some networking has been occurring organically.
Japan has concluded bilateral economic and security agreements with the Philippines and Australia.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is not just a deeply networked organization; it has also been actively cultivating relationships with its Northeast Asian neighbors through a set of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The Obama administration recognized this trend.
In 2016, it began to promote the idea of a “principled security network” in Asia – a tagline that is unlikely to survive Trump’s presidency.
Obama has also held trilateral meetings with Japan and South Korea.
Mesh networks are highly resilient, because no individual node is critical to the structure’s survival – even if one link breaks, the structure survives.
The logic is used in designing everything from fences to fishing nets.
It is time to apply it to Asian security arrangements.
If they take the right steps, America’s Asian allies may emerge from the Trump era more resilient and secure than ever.
– Mr President, I must congratulate Mrs Redondo on the modification she has made in relation to forests.
My group and I are going to support her, and I would also like to congratulate Mrs Wallström on her speech.
She is always so concerned and sensitive in relation to all environmental problems, as she has demonstrated in her speeches on the Spanish state and its distribution of water.
I agree with the whole of the report.
I believe that the increase by millions of euros for the reconstruction of forests struck by disasters is extremely sensitive, but I believe that there must be democratic control in all the countries of the Mediterranean so that the investments of this Parliament in relation to information, prevention and repopulation are properly complied with, because otherwise we may find in a few years’ time that we have not moved forward, and that we are still affected by the atmospheric situation, by global warming and by bad management on the part of the Member States.
We have been talking about diversity of forests throughout the whole of the European Union and we therefore believe that we must create a common forest policy for the whole of Europe.
– Mr President, I have been forced to note with some amazement that in both introductory speeches – in their discussions of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy – the words ‘environment’ and ‘sustainable development’ were never used.
I am not interested in formal acknowledgements or ritual tributes, but I do wonder, Mr Verheugen, if this is the type of continuity to which you alluded.
Apart from that, however, there are three good reasons to consider this third pillar of the Lisbon strategy to be still relevant.
The first is that a few days ago an international event of the greatest importance occurred, something highly positive for once: the ratification by the Duma of the Kyoto Protocol, a field in which the European Union has been a world leader.
The second is that, as chance would have it, the environment is precisely the field in which the Member States are furthest behind schedule in their implementation of Community policies.
There is yet another even more important reason, which has to do with the subject that government offices throughout Europe are quite rightly – and rather obsessively – concerned about at the moment: competitiveness.
How can the European Union regain its competitiveness in world markets if it does not commit itself to the new technologies, or if it does not take on leadership – including technological leadership – in the field of environmental technologies?
This is the issue that I am raising, and I hope it will be a key point in the strategy review process.
author. - (ES) Madam President, the description of sexual violence in Kivu, Congo, produces an unavoidable feeling of revulsion.
Our fellow Members have described what is going on there, and I do not intend to repeat it.
We must not merely agree to condemn it, since this could make us a voice crying in the wilderness: we have to do something to stop it, and what we can do is put pressure on the Congolese Government, because it is not just the rebels, but also its armed forces, who are carrying out these kinds of atrocities, aimed at humiliating women and undermining the moral foundations of the society in which they live.
We must make the United Nations and the European Union declare sexual violence a crime against humanity.
We must ask the Commission to allocate development assistance funds to the Congo, fundamentally and as a priority as assistance for the victims: legal assistance, social assistance and medical assistance.
We must make United Nations personnel on the ground consider defence of the victims and the search for those responsible priority tasks, and to do so we must extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to constitute a more direct link to the prevention of such occurrences.
Finally, we must call on those attending the Kivu Conference to produce a set of specific results demanding justice and acceptance of responsibility, because if, after all that has happened, rapists finally enjoy impunity wearing the uniforms of the official army of the Republic of the Congo, the victims will be humiliated twice - first during the rape itself, and again when they see it was carried out with impunity.
That is what we can and must do.
I trust the Commission will take due note of this, and rechannel development assistance funds for the Congo, as I have requested, to assist victims and prevent the continuation of this savage butchery of the dignity of women.
Brussels, 29 November 2005
European Commission launches public debate on the future of the European Migration Network
The Commission adopted today a Green Paper `On the future of the European Migration Network´.
The Commission will incorporate the findings of this comprehensive debate in its proposal for a legal basis for a future EMN to be adopted by the end of 2006.
Complementing the ongoing work of other EU bodies, such as EUROSTAT, the European Migration Network can make a valuable contribution.
Activities include the systematic collecting and storing of existing data and information from Member States and carrying out national and European-level analysis.
The Green Paper consists of two main parts.
A number of questions are asked under each of these headings.
(PL) Madam President, at the outset, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her very good, comprehensive and balanced report, as well as the Ombudsman for his unceasing work in combating maladministration as well as raising administration standards in the European Union.
As the rapporteur correctly pointed out, the last year of the Ombudsman's work has seen good management and progress in reducing the number of complaints and a shortening of the procedure for investigating complaints.
I think this is also an effect of continuity in holding office.
As can be seen, the selection of Mr Diamandouros was a very good decision.
The Ombudsman, however, must react quicker to the needs of citizens.
For this to be possible, he must cooperate more closely with national ombudsmen.
The function of European Ombudsman is a role that changes with time, but it must present a set of constant and universal values.
I believe that in his coming year of office he will listen more strenuously to the voices of the citizens.
(LT) I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Evgeni Kirilov, for his thorough and very significant report.
The European Union calls on Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to do everything they can to ensure that these countries become stable, peaceful and really democratic states where human and minority rights are guaranteed and where there is civilised competition between government and opposition.
It is not so easy to talk about regional cooperation when we know very well that all three countries have been damaged by frozen or completely fresh conflicts.
Nevertheless, the European experience (in particular, if we remember the origins of the European Union following bloody wars) is eloquent testimony to the fact that the only solution is to talk, negotiate, heal wounds and act with an eye to the future and not the past.
The countries of the South Caucasus will have a clearer European perspective if they are able to cooperate among themselves and in the broader region.
Clearly, that also depends on the behaviour of neighbouring countries.
The European Union has opportunities to play a more active political role in the South Caucasus to ensure, above all, the implementation of poverty reduction programmes, the alleviation of social isolation, gender equality and women's rights and investment in education and health care.
It is important to accelerate the development of direct contact between citizens of the South Caucasus and European Union Member States.
In particular, we ought to increase the number of students, teachers and researchers participating in mobility programmes.
That is the common interest we all share.
Thank you, Commissioner, for a very interesting speech in which you spoke about the important problems we are facing before Copenhagen.
You spoke for slightly longer than we expected, so I expect we will have shorter remarks from yourself at the end of the debate.
It was so interesting that it was not possible to stop it!
– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the organisation of healthcare in the Member States is based upon solidarity through hospital networks, social security systems and mutual insurance schemes.
The pharmaceutical industry, however, selects its patients on the basis of their resources – I am thinking of the diseases of poor countries – or on the basis of the numbers of patients involved.
That is why we now have to legislate on the question of medicinal products for paediatric use.
We welcome the fact that this report will be adopted tomorrow, as we all want children to have medication appropriate to their age and medical condition without delay.
Having said that, I regret – and Mrs Grossetête has also pointed this out – that the two-year period for marketing a medicinal product has been maintained, and, moreover, I regret that the amendment intended to cut that period has not been supported.
I also regret the long delay in obtaining an inventory of needs for paediatric treatments.
These delays belie the declarations of urgency made here in Parliament.
Finally, in relation to the provisions on risk management and pharmacovigilance, we must be careful to ensure they are properly implemented and, if necessary, be ready to amend our text.
Mr President, the threat of an avian influenza pandemic has plunged Europe and the world into a state of hysteria.
While I was in Brussels, I made inquiries into the situation in what may be Europe’s future capital.
It would appear that Tamiflu, which is the only antiviral drug effective against avian influenza and which is produced by the Swiss-based Roche, is not sold in pharmacies in Brussels, or in other words in Europe’s capital.
The pharmaceutical companies are making hundreds of millions of euro by whipping the public into a frenzy.
We are voicing our opinions on all the key European and global issues and other matters besides, but we are unable to provide minimum standards for our own citizens, even those living in the EU’s capital.
Mr President, it is my belief that the European Commission should take decisive steps to deal with this matter.
If it fails to do so, we will either be made to look like fools or face the risk of a potentially tragic pandemic.
(FR) Mr Barroso, I would like to inform you that, in a few days' time, we will be observing the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
The situation of the crushed, colonised, wounded, killed Palestinian population must not continue.
We Europeans, through our values of solidarity and fraternity, have a responsibility to find a solution to this situation quickly, before it turns into a bloodbath.
The Israeli Government is continuing its colonisations by forced march, and this after it committed war crimes at the start of this year.
Symbols and tears are no longer enough.
Today, the only solution to stop this deadly policy of the Israeli Government is the recognition and, above all, the existence of the Palestinian State.
The Palestinian people, like other peoples, have a right to a dignified existence that fulfils their aspirations.
As President of the Commission, and together with Mrs Ashton, will you take action along these lines and, if so, how?
34. Discharge 2010: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (
Madam President, in common with you I have the honour and responsibility of taking part for the first time in the decision-making process regarding the European Commission of the enlarged European Union.
I would like the European Parliament to perform this task with both dignity and credibility.
I was happy to vote for the future President of the Commission, not because he is from the beautiful country of Portugal, but because he presented a vision worthy of support.
Today he has reinforced that vision with a number of programme elements, with a clear desire for close collaboration with the European Parliament and also with the desire to lead the Commission in the spirit of the European Constitutional Agreement.
I am not interested in discussing today the outcome of the American elections or the fate of Berlusconi, nor should we be going right back to Adam and Eve.
We should be concerned with the future of the European Union and the strength of its Commission.
It is not our role to make judgements about the personal views of the candidates but to decide on the competence of the proposed Commission.
We have more than enough challenges ahead of us for us to be playing little games.
I am not happy about much of what I have read about the hearings, either on the left or on the right.
However, even if I did agree with the criticism, I cannot put the whole Commission at risk for the sake of one single majority vote in one of the committees for one of the candidates.
If we adopt the practice of making judgements according to some ideological yardstick fuelled by one or two sentences, or quotes taken entirely out of context, we will have difficulty finding a candidate who would survive, as everyone has, at some time in their life, said something that could easily be the subject of long political debates.
I will, of course, support a Commission which will operate in a collegial manner, based on the assurance of its President, and I wish it every success.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my first questions are for Commissioner Kroes.
Mrs Kroes, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive refers to an independent regulatory body.
Yet, positions in the new Hungarian media authority and the Media Council, who have powers to impose heavy penalties on vague grounds, are being taken up exclusively by supporters of the ruling party. That is taking place in an already highly polarised political environment.
Why has the Commission not objected to this lack of independence?
Why have you failed fully to assess the powers of the media authority and the Media Council, which, in my view, fall within the scope of European law, against the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
You, Mrs Kroes, have said that the Hungarian Government has so far made four amendments.
For the foreign press, for the audiovisual media, but not for domestic newspapers.
You would also like to see Mr Orban and his people triumphantly waving the stamp of approval, your Brussels flag, and then continue, uninterrupted, preaching intolerance, slandering philosophers and banning gay pride.
All of that, too, while Hungary is holding the presidency of the Council.
You must be deeply unhappy about that.
Moving next to my fellow members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), who said in their resolution that there was nothing to be concerned about and who have accused critics of the media law of making manipulative and politically motivated comments.
That is quite an accusation, and one which is also directed at the OSCE and the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe.
It is quite an accusation, given that we know that even Mr Orban himself has, in the mean time, realised that a few amendments need to be made to his media law.
This reminds me of the Stalinist days, where people were airbrushed out of photographs.
Together with us and the OSCE, you ought to be protecting European values, not becoming a mechanism for imposing your power at home.
(The Member agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as promised, we are here today, just one part-session later, in a position to present plenary with a report by our Committee on Fisheries on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Morocco.
We believed that our committee should not be deprived of the opportunity to debate this sensitive agreement, and it therefore had to be debated and approved by us first.
I believe that this time has been extremely useful: it has been useful for the rapporteur, who now has more information than he had before, and it has been useful in that it has given us a more in-depth awareness of what has been agreed and of what has not yet been agreed.
It has also made it possible for us to help the Commission to promote an Agreement in which certain very important issues are still subject to negotiation, entirely openly, as befits a Parliament.
We are in a position today, therefore, to ask the House to vote in favour of this Agreement, but with the reservations, the adjustments, the guarantees and improvements that we have introduced in the Committee on Fisheries and which are included in the report.
I believe that this report has improved the Agreement and Parliament’s institutional position and we have fully and responsibly carried out the duties for which we were elected.
Our real objective was, and remains, to improve the guarantees for the fisheries sector, which is the beneficiary of the Agreement, to ensure compliance with its clauses and to make it operative and viable.
We did not understand before, and we still do not understand, why some people were opposed to this exercise in responsibility and transparency.
In addition to the technical fisheries issues that I will comment on in a moment, the Agreement was politically sensitive because of the thorny issue of the Western Sahara, which we could not sidestep but which we could not get involved in either.
I have tried to remain neutral on this issue, acknowledging the problem but not speaking for any of the parties, in order to ensure that Parliament does not show any particular support for any one of them, though at all times respecting international law and the on-going dispute, and not ignoring it, including the United Nations’ doctrine regarding non autonomous territories.
The opinion of Parliament’s Legal Service has been extremely useful and has been incorporated into the report, as well as the amendments by Mrs Attwooll, whom I would like to thank for her sensitivity and understanding, and the only amendment approved by the Committee on Development relating to the Sahara.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Kindermann, coordinator of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for the assistance he has given me and for his efforts to keep his group united – although he has not achieved this entirely, I am aware of the efforts he has made.
I therefore believe, as rapporteur, that the report is balanced and reasonable, although compromises mean giving some ground and not everybody can be one hundred per cent satisfied.
I would now like to make a few comments about the strictly fisheries-related aspects of the report.
The European Parliament expresses its support for the Agreement but, as I have said, it reserves for itself the task of scrupulously monitoring its application, which is fully in accordance with our duties of control over the Commission, calling for an exhaustive annual report on its application and in particular demanding that we be kept informed of each and every modification introduced into the text; in particular, we ask to be made aware of any opinions the Commission issues with regard to the possible modification of the Agreement’s exclusivity clause.
We want to be made aware of how fisheries resources develop, in particular those species excluded from the agreement and of high commercial value, such as cephalopods and crustaceans, since, with the current exclusion, the Galician fleet is marginalised.
We also want to be informed of the measures adopted to allow the Andalusian fleet to fish with lamps, as it has been doing, and also to ensure that there is no discrimination in this fishing area or in the measures intended to ensure landing in local ports.
We also want to be kept informed of the technical measures that have not yet been clarified in relation to longline fishing and of the agreements of the joint committee that relate to the way in which the European Union’s financial contribution will be invested.
The final distribution of fishing opportunities must be communicated to Parliament, since adjustments are still being made to them at the moment.
To this end, we have approved the amendments by Mrs Fraga, so that distributions respect relative stability and the sector and Parliament can observe the application of these vital issues.
While it may appear irresponsible to prolong the parliamentary negotiation of this Agreement indefinitely, we believe that it would have been more irresponsible to approve it blindly and hence to approve it without these demands and guarantees.
Our wish has been to reassure all of the parties involved that the Agreement will be applied rigorously and seriously and in accordance with international rules.
That was our difficult commitment and will continue to be so in the future, in order to ensure that the European Parliament conscientiously monitors its application once it has entered into force, in accordance with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries and if the House adopts the report tomorrow, as I hope it will.
I would like to thank everybody for their understanding and cooperation.

Beyond Enlargement: Commission shifts European Neighbourhood Policy into higher gear
Having defined the guiding principles of the European Neighbourhood Policy last year, the Commission has now adopted a "Strategy Paper" proposing how the benefits of enlargement, i.e. peace, stability and prosperity, can be extended to the neighbours of the enlarged Union.
It also adopted reports assessing the situation in a number of the countries concerned.
The Council is now invited to draw up conclusions on how to carry this initiative forward.
"Today we are proposing to reinforce our ties with these partner countries through an array of new forms of co-operation and assistance.
We want to give them a real stake in the enlarged EU so that they too can develop and prosper.
A ring of well-governed countries around the EU, offering new perspectives for democracy and economic growth, is in the interests of Europe as a whole."
Reminder
In March 2003 the Commission presented its Communication on "Wider Europe Neighbourhood: A new framework for relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours" outlining the basic principles of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
In October 2003, the European Council welcomed this initiative and urged the Commission and the Council to take it forward.
These talks have confirmed their interest in European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and heard their views on the priorities to be addressed in possible ENP Action Plans.
Reports on the current situation in these countries and their co-operation with the EU are attached to the Communication.
Principles and scope
The objective of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is to share the benefits of the EU's 2004 enlargement with neighbouring countries i.e. stability, security and well-being - in a way that is distinct from EU membership.
It is designed to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged Union and its neighbours and to offer them the chance to participate in various EU activities through close political, security, economic and cultural co-operation.
ENP will also help address one of the strategic objectives the European Union set in the European Security Strategy in December 2003, that of building security in our neighbourhood.
The ENP is addressed to the EU's neighbours and, in particular, those that have drawn closer to the EU as a result of enlargement.
In Europe, this applies to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
In the Mediterranean region, the ENP applies to all the non-EU participants in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (also called the Barcelona process)(2) with the exception of Turkey, which is pursuing its relations with the EU in a pre-accession framework.
The Commission also recommends the inclusion of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia within the scope of ENP.
The European Security Strategy, adopted by the European Council in December 2003, clearly identifies the South Caucasus as one of the regions in which the EU should take a "stronger and more active interest".
A tailor-made approach
The Commission today proposes a method to meet the goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
This method consists in defining, together with partner countries, a set of priorities in jointly agreed Action Plans with a view to bringing these countries as close as possible to the European Union.
The pace at which the EU develops links with each partner will reflect the extent to which these common values are effectively shared.
The Action Plans will contain a number of priorities intended to strengthen commitment to these values.
economic and social development policy, offering neighbouring countries the prospect of a stake in the EU internal market based on legislative and regulatory approximation, the participation in a number of EU programmes (education and training, research and innovation) and improved interconnection and physical links with the EU (eg. in the fields of energy, transport, environment and information society)
trade: ENP foresees a greater market opening in accordance with the principles of the WTO and convergence with EU standards
Justice and Home Affairs: close co-operation to include issues like border management, migration, fight against terrorism, trafficking in human beings, drugs and arms, organised crime, money laundering and financial and economic crimes
The Action Plans will be differentiated, i.e. tailor-made to reflect the existing state of relations with each country, its needs and capacities as well as common interests.
The Action Plans will define the way ahead over the next three to five years.
The next step could consist in offering a new privileged partnership in the form of European Neighbourhood Agreements, to replace the present generation of bilateral agreements, when Action Plan priorities are met.
Towards a new financial instrument in support of ENP
The priorities set in the Action Plans will be a reference for the financial support provided by the EU to the countries concerned.
Assistance from existing sources mainly the TACIS and MEDA programmes will be complemented in the future by a new financial instrument from 2007, the European Neighbourhood Instrument, which will focus on cross-border co-operation along the external border of the enlarged EU.
For the period 2004-2006, the funding foreseen for ENP under external assistance programmes amounts to €255 million.
Approximately €700 million will be provided for the corresponding EU internal borders under the Interreg programme.
For the next financial perspective 2007-2013, the Commission intends to propose a substantial increase in the annual amounts to be allocated to the European Neighbourhood Instrument compared to those allocated during the period 2004-2006 to cross-border co-operation
Closer Regional Co-operation
The European Neighbourhood Policy also strongly encourages regional and sub-regional co-operation.
By further developing various forms of cross-border co-operation, the EU and its partners can work together to ensure that regions benefit from the EU's enlargement.
In the South, the ENP will also encourage the participants to reap the full benefits of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, notably through the promotion of infrastructure, interconnections and networks, in particular energy, and to develop new forms of co-operation with their neighbours.
Next steps
The Commission is transmitting the Communication to the Council and European Parliament.
On the basis of the conclusions that will be drawn by the Council, the Commission will begin to work on implementing the policy as set out in the Strategy Paper.
It is ready in the coming months, with the participation of the Presidency and the High Representative, to complete explanatory talks with the countries concerned and to present draft Action Plans.

As stated in the report, the Ecolabel is a voluntary mark whose purpose is to promote, at European level, the dissemination of high-efficiency products which have a low ecological impact throughout their life-cycle.
To this end, certain eco-quality standards have been fixed (we shall here call them 'criteria') for each of a number of specific product categories.
There are at present 26 product categories, 622 licences and over 3 000 products and services - detergents, paper, clothing (including shoes and textiles), tourism, camping products, etc. - for which Ecolabels have been awarded.
This mark and the flower that symbolises it are dynamising elements which, thanks to the constant updating of the environmental criteria for the products for which they are awarded, encourages enterprises to operate a virtuous cycle of effort with a view to the overall raising of the eco-quality of products on the market.
However, there seem to be several shortcomings in the current system, bearing in mind the experience obtained over the almost 10 years of existence of this certification, which points to the need for more decisive intervention with a view to dealing with certain shortcomings in the system.
It is in this context that the Commission has presented a proposal for a new regulation, which the Members are trying to improve.
author. - Mr President, the annual report on the human rights situation in Syria for 2006 makes very grim reading indeed.
Scores of arbitrary arrests and detentions of political opposition figures, reformists and human rights and civil society activists have taken place.
In addition, documented reports of torture used as a routine and systematic interrogation method of extracting confessions are found in abundance.
Furthermore, corrupt members of the Syrian judiciary, both civil and military, have been passing draconian sentences, including life incarceration and death sentences, influenced mainly by political motives.
We call upon the Syrian Government, in the face of international condemnation, to at last make a serious effort to improve respect for the human rights of its citizens or face the consequences, which I hope, with some reservation, will be forthcoming and drastic.
This call is addressed not just to the EU institutions but also to the EU Member States to ensure that a coherent policy is adopted and future tragedies averted.
Panagiotis Gkofas (Various Interests Group, Greece), EESC rapporteur for an opinion on irregular immigration by sea highlighted the scope of the problem: "
We need a policy based on solidarity so that it is not just southern Europe shouldering the responsibility.
These people do not come to stay in a small village in southern Europe.
They are using these countries as entry point to northern Europe; and this makes it a European problem".
The Member States that, because of their geographical location, are dealing with a large influx of irregular migrants, should be supported through mechanisms to share the cost of irregular immigration.
"No other issue has shown so openly the lack of solidarity among EU Member States: a lack of solidarity to those Member States on the frontline and a lack of solidarity towards people fleeing war in their own countries", said Stefano Mallia (Employers' Group, Malta), co-rapporteur of the opinion.
Mr Mallia closed by highlighting that: "
In this case there are no miracle solutions.
We need to take steps in the right direction to address a problem that will be with us for a long time.
And if we don't act now things will get worse."
Pariza Castanos (Workers' Group, Spain) rapporteur for another EESC own-initiative opinion on the need for a more inclusive form of citizenship, open to immigrants, stressed that: "
By failing to tackle the immigration issue in a coherent manner, the EU is failing to live up to its own values of respect for and protection of human life".
He also questioned the EU's commitment to the full integration of accepted migrants within society, calling for the issue of full citizenship for these migrants to be examined.
Mr Castanos continued by pointing out that that irregular immigrant should not be criminalized.
"They are not delinquents; they are often victims in the hands of criminal networks".
In this respect, cooperation with third countries is an essential prerequisite for combating criminal human trafficking networks, and this too must be supported by European mechanisms.
The Committee calls on the EU and its Member States to treat this disaster as a wake-up call and to act now on the recommendations made in these opinions before another tragedy is allowed to occur.

My Journey with Che
For millions of young people around the world, their introduction to Ernesto Che Guevara will be Gael Garia Bernal as Che and Rodrigo De la Serna as his friend Alberto, kicking back the stand of an overloaded motorcycle, hopping aboard, and lumbering north on an 8,000-mile journey through South America in the film version of Che's Motorcycle Diaries .
For those of us in Cuba old enough to take a similar trip, our journey with Che, the young man with the funny accent and starred beret, began with less romance.
"Pioneros por el comunismo, seremos como el Che!
(Pioneers for Communism, like Che we shall be!)," we repeated day after day before starting class.
The chant became so tedious that inevitably, the class clown would ask if the incantation would end up turning us all into asthmatics, as Che was.
Che's life and deeds all became part of a modern bible for young Cubans.
Even if we wanted to reject what was force-fed in chants or poems like "Che Comandante," it was hard to resist the charm and passion that came from his letters and diaries.
In his speeches, I discovered the brilliant Che, mercilessly railing against inefficiency, false politics, and double standards.
"If we lack organization, the ideas, after the impetus of the first moment, lose their effectiveness, fall into the basic routines and conformity, and become simply a memory," he once said.
I looked around our island and wondered: was anyone listening?
I discovered the Che who scribbled love poems and coveted his solitude.
I wanted to sit with him for a beer and a cigarette to talk about his love for chess or his favorite books.
With the crisis of the 1990's brought on by the collapse of our Soviet patron, many Cubans returned to what Che said about economics, and admit the value of what is achieved with effort.
We felt once again the integrity of what it's like to share the burden of a common predicament.
The value of our homemade solutions increased to some who had always favored ideas imported from the East.
Then Che's face flooded our lives, staring at us from T-shirts, banners, walls, and key rings, with a look as vigilant as those on the faces in the murals of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.
The solemn face that Alberto Korda caught in his photographs became tough and unsympathetic.
He stopped being San Ernesto de la Izquierda, the saint or talisman who delivered us from injustice.
Instead, he rose like the flag of the trivial in a global mass culture - a sign associated with consumer tastes in fashion, music, and drugs.
To rediscover the Che who could inspire, I returned to the young Ernesto of Che's diary.
I thought again about how on his trip through Latin America, he acquired his revolutionary ideals, clarified certain questions, and added more.
I loved how he was brave enough to postpone his life for a while to find his own answers.
Today, a photo of Che's image displayed on the façade of Cuba's Interior Ministry is a must-have for tourists.
Visitors leave and continue their imaginary leftist lives with full refrigerators.
We Cubans remain, in charge of keeping the flame alive.
I wonder, Ernesto, what you would have turned into had you lived?
An archetype feeding the legend?
A general talking down to us with reprimands?
A favorite leader?
A twenty-first century Quixote tilting at the windmills of canned politics?
A postcard?
A repressor of feelings?
Or just another dinosaur?
Brussels, 2 August 2002
The European Commission adopted today new co-operation strategies for the Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay -, with indicative funding totalling up to € 200 million for the period 2002-2006.
Priorities for EC support programmes will be support for regional integration, economic reform and promotion of trade capacities, social development and poverty alleviation, modernization of the state, and protection of the environment.
These major support programmes, embedded in new Country Strategy Papers, are endowed with € 65.7 million for Argentina, close to € 64 million for Brazil, up to € 51.7 million for Paraguay and € 18.6 million for Uruguay.
Commenting the adoption of this package, President Romano Prodi said: "
Reinforced integration will allow Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to overcome present difficult times.
As our experience in Europe has proven, it will allow Mercosur to transform itself into a strong community of nations based on common values of democracy and social justice, offering its citizens new opportunities and prosperity.
Last week in Rio, Chris Patten and Pascal Lamy with their Mercosur counterparts injected new momentum into our ambitious iter-regioanl association negotiations.
Today's decision is another sign of the EU's long-term commitment to Mercosur."
The EU itself stands as a testimony to this interdependence, as does the evolution of Mercosur.
Let us now join forces in tackling structural causes for instability.
The fruits of two decades of democracy and market liberalisation must be preserved, while promoting more accountable public institutions, increased international competitiveness and fighting poverty and environmental degradation."
This reaffirmation of EU support for the Mercosur process comes at a crucial time for the region.
All Mercosur countries, including Uruguay and Paraguay, are currently being affected by the repercussions of the Argentinean crisis and are going through difficult times.
Mercosur is of strategic interest to the European Union and the Commission has supported Mercosur from its very foundation in 1991.
Negotiations on the first inter-regional association agreement ever concluded are being intensified between the EU and Mercosur.
In recent days renewed financial turbulence has hit the Mercosur region, in particular Brazil and Uruguay.
The European Commission is confident that these countries will be able to weather the current storm and trusts that the existing good relationships between the IMF and Brazil and the IMF and Uruguay will deliver positive results for each of the countries and the entire the region.
The European Commission considers that continued support for and solidarity with Mercosur countries should be shown by all partners at the present time, based on governments concerned implementing responsible economic policies.
Separate press releases are available with regard to the country strategies for: Argentina:

Excise duties: Commission welcomes Council adoption of new rules to strengthen cooperation between tax authorities
The Regulation, based on a Commission proposal of January 2004 (see IP/04/28), will complement the initiative to computerise the movement of excisable goods in the Community adopted in June 2003 (see IP/03/788) and is the counterpart to rules strengthening administrative co-operation in the VAT and direct tax fields adopted by the Council over the last year (see IP/03/1350 and IP/04/539).
"While tax fraud is by its very nature difficult to quantify, it is clear that excise duty fraud is a serious problem for many EU Member States" commented Taxation Commissioner Frits Bolkestein.
In particular, it will
formalise the procedures for officials from one Member State to carry out investigations in another
establish procedures for simultaneous audits by officials from two or more Member States
provide for transmission of statistical information to the Commission so as to allow the Commission to play a coordinating and facilitating role
provide for information exchange with non-EU countries.
Background
http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/whatsnew.htm
(RO) Madam President, on 12 January 2010, the state of Haiti was literally swept away, as has also been mentioned by many fellow Members.
At present, one year after this awful earthquake, the country is still awaiting reconstruction.
In the meantime, its troubles have been added to by the cholera epidemic and elections, all of which has complicated the situation.
In actual fact, Port-au-Prince is a vast refugee camp at the moment.
The Haitian population is only surviving thanks to the humanitarian organisations' efforts.
Indeed, we must be grateful to these organisations.
As the UN Special Representative for this country stated, Haiti has become a republic of NGOs.
However, how long can this situation last?
We can see that the health situation is disastrous, the reconstruction of the education system is an absolute must, not to mention the process of getting rid of the traces of the disaster.
All this creates the need to rebuild the Haitian state.
Apart from the earthquake, the absence of institutions and good governance is a huge problem at the moment.
Therefore, efforts must be focused on restoring the capacity of the state and on building democracy in Haiti.
The need must be spelt out in very strong terms for a credible, transparent electoral process with the prospect of the second round of the elections in February.
The final point I would like to make is that Haiti must be rebuilt, if you permit me to say so, differently.
By 'differently', I mean that reconstruction must be of better quality than before to prevent the recurrence of similar disasters.
By 'differently', I also mean that our efforts to rebuild the country must involve, I would say, the local communities.
I believe that the main stakeholders, the Haitian people, must be consulted during this reconstruction process.
Judgment in Case C‑22/11
Finnair Oyj v Timy Lassooy
An air carrier must compensate passengers when they have been denied boarding because their flight was rescheduled as a result of a strike at the airport two days before hand
The regulation on compensation and assistance to passengers (‘the regulation’) 1 grants certain rights to air passengers departing from or flying to an airport located in a Member State.
However, the regulation provides for cases where there are grounds for a carrier to deny boarding.
With the exception of those cases, passengers are entitled to be compensated immediately, be reimbursed their tickets or be re-routed to their final destination and cared for while awaiting a later flight.
None of these passengers received any compensation from Finnair.
That interpretation follows not only from the wording of the regulation, but also from its objective, namely that of ensuring a high level of protection for air passengers.
With the aim of reducing the number of passengers denied boarding against their will, which was too high, the EU legislature introduced new legislation in 2004 construing the concept of ‘denied boarding’ more broadly, covering all circumstances in which an air carrier refuses to carry a passenger.
The Court considers that a denial of boarding such as that in question in the present case may not be placed on the same footing as those reasons, since the ground for denying boarding in question is not attributable to the passenger.
Such an increase would necessarily have the consequence of depriving passengers on the subsequent flights of all protection, which would be contrary to the objective of the regulation.
That is the case of the passengers denied boarding on the day of the strike.
Nonethe less, the Court points out that that conclusion does not prevent air carriers from seeking compensation from any person who has caused the denied boarding, including third parties.
Such compensation may reduce or even remove the financial burden borne by the carriers.
NOTE: A reference for a preliminary ruling allows the courts and tribunals of the Member States, in disputes which have been brought before them, to refer questions to the Court of Justice about the interpretation of European Union law or the validity of a European Union act.
The Court of Justice does not decide the dispute itself.
Unofficial document for media use, not binding on the Court of Justice.
The full text of the judgment is published on the CURIA website on the day of delivery.

Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Seeber on his work. My congratulations to him.
In this House today we have described underground sources of water as a key natural resource. We have to protect them against contamination.
Now, conversely, we are discussing ways of protecting ourselves against the destructive effects of water as an element, or in other words against floods.
Here I must emphasise the need for close cooperation on this among the Member States and countries outside the European Union.
Obviously we cannot disregard the principles of subsidiarity and flexibility.
I do think, however, that some standardisation both as regards legislation and the principles governing crisis management in the event of floods, and as regards ensuring full compatibility of life-saving equipment, is necessary.
This will make rapid and coordinated help possible, which is very important in the basins of rivers that flow through more than one country.
The rapporteur rightly puts great emphasis on avoiding floods and the need for protection and an early-warning system.
In addition, the inhabitants of threatened areas need to be properly prepared, both through education in schools and by smoothly functioning civil defence systems.
In Poland, where this year we experienced flood damage both in the Podkarpackie region and in Malopolska, the Volunteer Fire Brigade have played a very important role in rescue operations for many years, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank them publicly for that.
I would like to add my voice to those who regard the careless use of farmland as having a negative effect on the threat of floods, along with the careless felling of forests, the siting of residential areas in flood plains and so on.
We should note that only a proportion of natural disasters, including floods, are caused by natural forces beyond human control.
However, a significant number of these disasters, which often cause loss of life, injuries and huge material damage, are the result of human irresponsibility or indifference.
Let us therefore be wise before the event and minimise our losses.
The directive we are now debating aims to help with this, and let us hope it will be effective.
New EU funding announced today will provide grants, worth €150,000 each, for top-level researchers to bridge the gap between their work and marketable innovation.
The European Research Council (ERC) has today published the outcome of the latest round of its top-up funding scheme 'Proof of Concept.
Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science Máire Geoghegan-Quinn said: "
This second round of 'Proof of concept' grants is great news, as we need to bring more of our best ideas to market in Europe.
This initiative helps ERC grant holders to realise the potential of their breakthroughs and discoveries.
The first deadline in May 2012 attracted 75 proposals, resulting in 33 winners announced in September 2012.

Background
The European Research Council launched the new funding initiative, the 'Proof of Concept' , in March 2011, to contribute to stimulating innovation.
The call is open to all Principal Investigators benefitting from an on-going ERC grant or a grant that ended less than twelve months before the publication date of the call.
The funding is for up to one year per grant.
Set up in 2007 by the EU, the European Research Council is the first pan-European funding organisation for frontier research.
The ERC also strives to attract top researchers from anywhere in the world to come to Europe.
The ERC operates according to an "investigator-driven", or "bottom-up", approach, allowing researchers to identify new opportunities in any field of research.
Since its launch, the ERC has funded over 3,100 frontier research projects throughout Europe and has become a "benchmark" for excellent research.

Brussels, 6 th November 2009
The European Commission has authorised, under EC Treaty state aid rules, a Belgian measure aimed at limiting the adverse impact of the current financial crisis on exporting firms.
The Commission found the measure to be in line with its Temporary Framework for state aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis (see IP/08/1993 ).
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "
The Commission concluded that the measure complied with the conditions laid down in its Temporary Framework for state aid measure to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis (see IP/08/1993 ).
In particular, the measure meets the following criteria:
The necessary cover has become unavailable from the private insurance market as a consequence of the financial crisis.
The premiums charged under the public scheme are aligned with those of the private market, as stipulated in the Commission's Communication on short-term export-credit insurance.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number N 532/2009 in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.
New publications of state aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the State Aid Weekly e-News .
Mr President, when Member States ratify the Reform Treaty, as we hope and believe they will, we can look forward, at long last, to a revitalised European Union - a Union with the capacity to confront new challenges, with the humility to listen to its citizens and with the political will to act.
Ratification of the Treaty cannot come a moment too soon, and my Group thanks you, Mr Zapatero, for your efforts to speed up the process.
My Group sees no need for a group of wise people to ponder Europe's future.
We have been there, done that, and even have the T-shirts to prove it.
It was called 'the period of reflection' and it has come to an end.
We are midway through the Lisbon Strategy and are only now making progress in growth and jobs.
We are completing the single market, freeing up the potential of Europe's entrepreneurs.
We are opening legal migration pathways to help both developing and developed economies.
Now is not the time to go back to a French drawing board, nor to follow a new British plan for a glorified free trade zone.
Those visions are just views from the margins, packaged as majority opinion.
They are not where consensus lies.
The majority of our citizens want the Union to deliver a strong and growing economy.
They want more EU involvement across the board, more involvement in combating terrorism, more cooperation in security and defence, and more action on the environment.
Then, and only then, can Europe become a global player with the capacity to bring about lasting change.
For how can we assure growth and jobs if Europe retreats into protectionism?
How can we combat climate change if we fail to act in concert?
How can we spread peace, prosperity and justice in the world if Europe bickers at the sidelines?
That is why Europe needs more politicians who are prepared to lead and to take a pan-European approach.
Mr Zapatero, by uniting the 18 friends of the Constitution in Madrid, you proved that your vision of an open, integrated and competitive Europe is one shared by many.
It is that vision of Europe that progressives from all parties in this House want to see thrive and expand.
The ALDE Group will work together with all those who share that vision and live up to it, whether on the right, on the left or in the centre, to ensure Europe moves forward.
What we will not tolerate are those who profess such a vision but fail to live up to it.
Prime Minister, Spain is often quite rightly praised for its social and economic transformation since joining the Union.
We need others to follow your example and pursue your ambition for a prosperous and open Europe.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his report.
We have made a good few improvements: we have stronger rules for residue and we have better definitions of good agricultural practices.
It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor.
However, looking at what has been proposed, we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management, which everybody should welcome.
With regard to aggregate MRLs, if, for example, there are two or three different pesticides, but they are all below the MRLs, the combination should say that they should not be on the market.
That is the same logic that we have been pushing for years in relation to drinking water.
We are glad to see that this has now been accepted.
There are lots of pesticides, but no proper analysis is available.
If there is no valid lab analysis and no detection methods available then the pesticides have to be taken off the market.
Authorisation must be withdrawn on these.
If new scientific evidence reveals a risk, the same should apply.
Some of the amendments we tabled in committee asked for zero tolerance for imported products.
These were rejected as the majority thought it was necessary to give specific MRLs for imported products that are not grown in the EU, such as tropical fruits.
We have tabled this amendment again.
I say to Mr Sturdy that the purpose of this amendment from Mr Lannoye is not about stopping imports but about protecting consumers.
With regard to the amendment asking for temporary MRLs to be set at the lowest level of those suggested, it was not voted on in committee because it was supposed to be included in the compromise.
We have tabled some amendments again.
We hope we can get support for them because they would improve the overall end result.
Are there any objections to the inclusion of these oral amendments?
(The oral amendments were accepted)
.   It goes without saying that cooperation with Russia is of key importance for the European Union.
The same also applies to the problem of secure energy supplies, to which Russia can provide a partial solution.
At the same time, however, there can be no one who is not concerned at the way in which the major energy companies operate in Russia.
I need only remind the House that the head of Gazprom leads Putin’s cabinet, that his deputy chief of staff, Mr Sechin, runs Rosneft, and that Mr Ivanov, Mr Surkov and Mr Prikhodko are in charge of Transneft, Aeroflot and so on.
This all begs the question of whether these companies are in fact operating according to market mechanisms, or whether they are instead instruments of Russian foreign policy.
A great many recent developments, such as the problems experienced with the supply of crude oil to Ukraine, suggest that the latter is the case.
A further question that needs to be addressed relates to the future direction of Russian policy.
No one could fail to be alarmed at the bill presented by Mr Dmitri Rogozin to the Duma, which, if it is adopted, will make it possible for Russia to incorporate whole new regions into the Russian Federation without anyone’s permission.
Those justifying such a move have made it quite clear which regions are involved, and these include Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transdnistria.
This leaves us with the problem of whether we should not occasionally alert Russia to our concerns, which are entirely justified.
Of course, it will be Russia that decides on the future shape of our relations with Russia and on the future face of Russia itself, but I do not believe that there should be any letup in our efforts to highlight certain concerns.
– At the root of the brutal attacks on Palestine and Lebanon is the USA’s plan for Middle East domination.
The USA actively pursues a policy of interference and shows scant regard for sovereignty and international law, and its ultimate goal is the geostrategic control of the region and control over the region's ample energy resources.
Within a context of contradictions, there has been broad agreement between the major powers of the EU and the USA, with the process of drawing up Resolution 1701 a prime example of this.
The EU has never condemned Israeli aggression, demanded a cease-fire or called for international law to be respected.
The reality of the situation must not be obfuscated by transforming the victim into the aggressor and vice versa.
It is Israel that is illegally occupying Arab territories, Israel that fails to honour the many UN resolutions and Israel that actively undermines the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian State by means of a policy of State terrorism.
For there to be peace in the region, Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories, dismantle the settlements and the wall and release political detainees; refugees must be able to return, and an independent, sovereign Palestinian State must be created with East Jerusalem as its capital.
All States in the region must be guaranteed their sovereignty and security, and the region must be demilitarised and rendered free of nuclear weapons.
. I have never said – because it would be incorrect – that our efforts are concerned only with Catholics or only with Christians.
Freedom of religion is a human right that applies to all religions moving within the democratic framework.
Falun Gong is a special case, especially because we know, as you mentioned, that degradation and torture are used.
We are of course following this with great concern and are also raising it repeatedly.
You mentioned the re-education camps.
We have raised them as well, not only in connection with religious freedom but generally.
The Chinese side has known for many years that re-education camps have long been a thorn in the flesh of the European Union, because they certainly do not meet the normal international standards of human rights.
You can therefore be assured, honourable Member, that we are also seeking to end the suppression of the Falun Gong faith and its adherents.
The proposed directive for the establishment of European groupings for cross-border cooperation was conceived as part of the reformed cohesion policy, which will be made available to members if they so wish.
It still remains in no small measure controversial, which is a result of the fact that, because of its legal nature, it is not in any way whatsoever a tool.
It represents an instrument of the new generation of European policy, established in light of the constitutional goal of increasing geographical cohesion and based on the substantial experience of those regions that in years gone by developed cross-border cooperation within the framework of Interreg and ran into problems as a result of different national legislation.
The new groupings introduced by this directive will be by their very nature purposeful.
Previously competent regions will, with this document, be in a position to implement regional projects of a cross-border nature.
The advantage will be that such activity will no longer be at the mercy of changes in parliamentary majorities in the Member States, and there will therefore be no need for them to be organised at the lowest level.
The new directive differs from the previous practice of interregional cooperation in that such cooperation will have to be carried out at a higher level.
The difference is the legal distribution of duties, which, of course, increases the responsibility of agencies and heightens financial responsibility when dealing with joint resources.
As far as resources from European Union funds are concerned, the state remains financially responsible and will remain so when these resources are managed by groupings.
In the case of other resources, the groupings themselves will be responsible.
The Commission's original proposal had to be supplemented with respect to the competence of the supervisory bodies of any state whose law will be selected.
There must not be any area not legally regulated in an unambiguous way.
We believe that the proposed amendments, which we have adjusted with the rapporteur, have filled any such gaps satisfactorily.
We will see in practice whether our hypotheses were correct.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is something wrong about holding a debate in May 2011 on a natural disaster that occurred in summer 2010, a disaster that left 12 million people homeless and destroyed 20% of the country concerned.
I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now.
It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty.
I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis.
It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments - among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 - that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause.
However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities.
We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its 'no' stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations.
True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan's poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack.
Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours.
We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India.
Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis' part.
It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan's Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results.
Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking - as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly - quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters.
This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations.
Commissioner Byrne, thank you for the explanation, which can almost be seen as an extremely accurate description of the situation.
My speech is, I am sorry to say, based on press information, information which – at least as regards Italy – is awakening considerable concerns since, for example, dead peregrine falcons and migratory ducks, two species of a very resistant nature, have been discovered.
I would now like to make two simple and precise comments.
The first concerns the health aspect.
We are not being caught completely unawares by the H5N1 strain, because it was identified back in 1997 and it reappeared as H7N1 between 1999 and 2001. Now, because the strain is continually mutating, we would ask the Commission what it intends to do as regards prevention, because – as some Members rightly stated before me – we always spring into action after the emergency arises.
Some Member States are equipped with their own national laboratories, but the European Centre for Infectious Diseases must set up a group to monitor the ways in which the health situation is monitored in the Member States.
The second aspect concerns the Commission’s work.
As Commissioner Lamy announced, there is an extremely serious option, within the talks to revive the WTO, aimed at increasing the number of countries involved in the EBA initiative.
So then, what are the guarantees offered to our consumers as regards the globalisation of markets?
Does the Commission not believe that, on this subject, a think-tank should be set up, within the actual context of the WTO, concerning the relationship between globalisation and health problems?
We shall carry on voting and we shall continue with the Schwab report.
But could somebody from the Secretariat please verify where the Council is.
Madam President, High Representative, on Christmas night, 2009 - while we were on our Christmas recess, in other words - a number of churches in Iraq, Mesopotamia, were closed.
Threats of bombings led to this sad situation, just as they had last year.
In any case, the churches often remain empty, with or without such threats, as more and more Christians are leaving the country.
The violence against them just goes on increasing, despite their shrinking numbers.
Before Christmas, there were three deadly attacks in Mosul.
Moreover, the Christians in the previously relatively safe city of Kirkuk, too, have, for several months, faced a simply unrelenting series of kidnappings and killings, resulting in the flight of hundreds of Christian families.
While there were around 1.5 million Christians in Iraq in 2003, more than half of them have now sought safety from religious cleansing in flight, religious cleansing that is being performed by Islamic extremists.
Is the European Council, are the 27 Member States of the European Union, just watching on meekly as this Afghanisation of Iraq takes place, an Iraqi Christian has asked.
I would appreciate hearing your position on this, High Representative.
Whatever it may be, a Mesopotamia without its ancient Christian community will not face a more tolerant future, nor will that be good for Europe's security in the long term.
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Cashman for the pleasant company as he discussed these extremely pressing and important issues.
I would also like to say that it was interesting for me as an old Swedish parliamentarian to be here in the European Parliament and witness the attempts to reach consensus.
We did not expect our groups to manage to reach complete agreement.
Now Mr Cashman is saying - and I entirely agree with him - that we need more resources.
However, I do not believe that it should always be a question of more taxes.
I would say this: give the entrepreneurs free rein and give them a chance in the poor countries so that jobs are created.
I do not believe that the moratorium proposed by Mr Cashman is a wise move either.
However, I would very much like to underline what is stated in paragraph 47, which strongly urges us to get to grips with the discrimination against certain groups that is found in the many poor countries.
This is something that I, and surely many other people, think is an issue that we need to spend a lot of time on in our discussion of the Millennium Development Goals.
There is talk about 0.7%.
I would very much like us to talk about 1% of GNI, because I believe that the rich countries actually have a responsibility to ensure that they at least achieve this amount.
Then there is another matter.
I do not believe that it is particularly wise to take the decision that the countries must attain 0.7% even if we want to, because I believe that in many respects this would be a waste of time.
However, these issues are urgent and, from a moral point of view, are the most pressing issues that this Chamber could be concerned with.
The fact that people are dying of hunger and thirst should be something that all Members of the European Parliament find intolerable.
Why Western Countries Must Accept Returning Extremists
OSLO/LONDON – Shamima Begum, a 19-year-old British woman who fled to Syria four years ago to marry an Islamic State (ISIS) fighter, wants to return home to the United Kingdom with her newborn son.
Similarly, Hoda Muthana, a 24-year-old American woman who joined ISIS at age 20, has requested re-entry to the United States with her young child.
Both have been rejected.
But their cases continue to fuel heated debate about the rights of would-be returnees – and, more broadly, the compatibility between Muslims and the West.
Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
In Begum’s case, the UK government has decided to revoke her citizenship, even though British law prohibits it if doing so renders a person stateless.
The UK Home Office has apparently concluded that Begum’s mother’s Bangladeshi passport provides a sufficiently credible excuse to ignore this rule.
Begum reportedly plans to appeal the decision.
As for Muthana, the US has argued that she was never really a citizen at all.
Yes, she was born in New Jersey and received a US passport before fleeing to join ISIS.
But the US State Department contends that her father was a Yemeni diplomat, and children born to active diplomats in the US do not receive birthright citizenship.
Muthana, however, was born months after her father left his position, which has become the basis of a lawsuit filed by her father against US President Donald Trump’s administration.
Like it or not, Begum and Muthana have a point.
Their respective governments have failed to respect the rights of a citizen to a fair trial – meaning, in this case, criminal prosecution and an appropriate punishment under the law.
Many see no problem with that: these young women forfeited their rights when they chose to leave their home countries and join a group that regards those countries as the enemy.
And political leaders, eager to score points with voters, are happy to endorse this view.
But, as the late Kofi Annan, a former secretary-general of the United Nations, often emphasized, such short-term, politically motivated thinking reflects a lack of vision and amounts ultimately to a failure of leadership.
The long-term implications of abandoning responsibility for returnees from extremist groups are serious.
Young people who flee to join extremist groups are typically motivated by a sense of deep isolation and a desire for purpose.
By excluding such people publicly and formally from our societies, we reinforce their sense of isolation and powerlessness – the opposite of what is needed to fight extremism and reduce the threat to their home countries.
Returnees have a right to due process.
Denying them that right violates the fundamental rule-of-law principles on which democracies are built.
That plays into the hands of fundamentalists and extremists, who accuse Western governments of preaching human rights and equality before the law only when it suits them.
The best way to defend Western values is by upholding them.
Beyond their responsibility to their citizens, Western countries have a responsibility to the rest of the world.
Many European countries – such as the UK, Germany, and France – have been major exporters of extremists to the Middle East.
As much as we wish that these people – hundreds of whom have already returned – were not our problem, they are.
Making them other countries’ problem is not a solution.
Rather than disregarding rights when it suits us – as the extremists do – the West must adopt a values-based approach to dealing with returnees.
Such an approach would focus on creating structures and mechanisms for rehabilitating and reintegrating returnees from extremist groups in Syria and elsewhere.
Here, countries like Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, with their dedicated reintegration facilities, strong support networks, and effective coordination among government agencies, provide an important model.
As with any new problem confronting our societies, the issue of returnees demands that we upgrade our institutions, or even create new ones, to ensure that we are equipped to handle the relevant challenges.
De-radicalization and reintegration are not rocket science, but they do require strong political will and adequate resources.
Of course, the best-case scenario is to prevent radicalization in the first place.
That is why in 2017, “Extremely Together,” a Kofi Annan Foundation initiative in which ten young people from around the world (including us) work to counter violent extremism, released the world’s first counter-extremism guide for young people by young people.
The return of violent extremists to Western countries is not an insurmountable problem.
But forsaking our own principles would be.
Mr President, the joy of the magnificent Christmas present among the 21st century new European citizens is understandable.
The expansion of the Schengen area - this special Portuguese flavour - is a historic event of great psychological and symbolic magnitude, lifting not only the borders and divisions in Europe.
Yet, whilst for us it is now possible to travel from the Baltic Vilnius to the Atlantic Lisbon, a new European curtain is being pulled in front of Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and Belarus, a financial and bureaucratic one in place of that very old iron.
Not so long ago, our neighbours could travel visa-free to many new Schengen countries, but now they must pay between EUR 35 and 60.
This is a quarter or even a third of a monthly salary in some of these countries.
We do not need the fortress of Europe while the Schengen acquis, with some improvements, is the key to a stronger and more inclusive Europe.
Time to Ratify New START
WARSAW – As a long-time observer of American politics, I know that United States senators will decide whether to ratify New START, the arms control treaty with Russia negotiated this year, on the basis of a thorough evaluation of their country’s national interests.
As the democratically elected representatives of the American people, they alone can determine what those interests are.
The US remains the world’s most powerful state, however, and the senators’ decision will inevitably have an impact beyond their country’s borders.
It will be particularly significant for Poland, a staunch ally of the US in NATO.
So it is important to make clear: my government supports the ratification of New START, because we believe it will bolster our country’s security, and that of Europe as a whole.
President Barack Obama’s nuclear-disarmament efforts have gained wide support in Poland.
The country’s first democratic prime minister, along with two former presidents, including Lech Wałęsa, the legendary leader of Solidarity, published a joint article last year in support of Obama’s bold disarmament agenda.
For almost a year now, since the expiration of the original START treaty in December 2009, no US inspectors have been on the ground in Russia to verify the state of its nuclear arsenal.
The START verification provisions provide crucial information that is essential for the force-planning process.
Without a treaty in place, holes will soon appear in the nuclear umbrella that the US provides to Poland and other allies under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the collective security guarantee for NATO members.
Moreover, New START is a necessary stepping-stone to future negotiations with Russia about reductions in tactical nuclear arsenals, and a prerequisite for the successful revival of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE).
While we in Poland do not perceive an immediate military threat from Russia, most of the world’s active tactical or sub-strategic nuclear weapons today seem to be deployed just east of Poland’s borders, in speculative preparation for conflict in Europe.
The cataclysmic potential of such a conflict makes it essential to limit and eventually eliminate this leftover from the Cold War.
This was the reasoning behind the Polish-Norwegian initiative aimed at addressing the issue of tactical nuclear weapons within the larger arms-control framework that was launched in this past April.
In effect, New START is the sine qua nonfor effective US leadership on the arms-control and non-proliferation issues that matter to Europe – from reviving the CFE treaty to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
More broadly, New START will cement the new, more positive tone in relations between Russia and the West.
Indeed, we in Poland have adopted our own way of reconciliation with Russia, one based on dialogue and reciprocity.
As a result, Polish-Russian relations have improved significantly over the last three years – no easy feat, given the burden of our shared history.
Though difficulties still lie ahead, Poland is determined to build a relationship with Russia based on mutual respect.
Also in the cards is more substantive cooperation between NATO and Russia in the field of missile defense, an issue discussed at this year’s NATO-Russia Summit in Lisbon, and that has the potential to transform NATO-Russia relations.
In order for that to happen, Russia’s leaders must come to view missile defense as an opportunity to work together to address common threats, rather than a threat in itself.
Ratification of New START will increase mutual trust and show that the West and Russia, despite our disagreements, can work together on issues critical to our common security.
Any delay to the treaty, however, will embolden those in Moscow who would rather have the West as an enemy than as a partner – and who thus would like to see the tenuous progress made in recent months to be undone.
Meanwhile, the Obama administration continues to pursue its plans for European missile defense.
More than a year ago, Poland decided to take part in the new Phased Adaptive Approach, which will primarily protect America’s European allies. The Polish government has agreed to host elements of the modified European Missile Defense System on Polish territory in the second half of the decade.
I hope that US senators take into account the view from Warsaw in making their decisions.
New START is in the interest of disarmament and of Europe.
Poland supports ratification of this vitally important treaty.
- Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this, because of the absolutely brilliant address that we heard from the President of the Czech Republic.
He reminded us of the history of his and many countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, which were occupied by the Nazis and then, effectively, by the Communists.
That really demonstrates the vital importance of NATO and its maintenance.
The European Union has a role in society, but the principal defence of the West is still NATO, and it is so because it is our alliance with the United States of America.
One of the disturbing features of this Parliament, which I find on so many issues, is an undercurrent and sometimes overcurrent of anti-American feeling.
It was the United States that ensured that we are speaking here as free peoples, and NATO guarantees that vital alliance for the years to come.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs for the work they have done and for the helpful cooperation on their part.
When we launch, shortly, a more general debate in response to Mr Brian Simpson's report on aviation agreements, we will get an opportunity to address more thoroughly the general approach and strategy with regard to this sort of agreement.
We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, emphatically support the replacement of old bilateral agreements between our Member States and third countries with comprehensive global agreements at European level.
This is the best guarantee of a level playing field for all our airlines.
It will also strengthen the integration of our own aviation sector as it will, of course, our negotiating position in relation to third countries.
It is important, in that regard, that we pay attention not only to the opening up of the market for additional flying rights and suchlike, but also to a strengthening of the regulatory framework in the environmental and social fields and the fields of safety and security.
We absolutely have to bring these into line with each other, at a very high level.
Another important point to mention here is that, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force, Parliament is not just supposed to give an opinion, but really has to approve these agreements as well.
My message, therefore, to the Commission and the Council is that they should make full use of those powers and that Parliament, therefore, should retain its say in approving or modifying additions or other amendments at a later stage.
With regard to the agreements before us, our group believes that the agreement with Canada comes the closest to the model that we have in mind, that is extensive cooperation in the fields of security, social issues and consumer and environmental protection.
Indeed, the rapporteur has rightly observed that the sections on social issues should have been worded a little more strongly, but that can be resolved in the Joint Committee which will now have to make a few things concrete.
Besides that cooperation, there is also the gradual introduction of additional flying rights and the gradual extension of the opportunity to become a shareholder in each other's airlines.
The agreement with Vietnam also reminds us of the growing importance of the Asian market, and I think that, on this particular point, we have to point out that the Council has been dragging its heels for years over giving the Commission a mandate to negotiate with countries such as China and India.
That mandate is essential, of course, if we are to make progress on this.
By way of conclusion, I would like to say a few things about the agreement with the United States, particularly regarding the second stage.
This concerns an area which covers 60% of the world aviation market and is therefore extremely important.
I personally was a rapporteur for this House when, a few years ago, the first stage was approved.
With regard to the United States, we are not completely satisfied because some things still have to happen in terms of market access.
We ask the Commission to give an undertaking that this will not be the end, that it will proceed on the course of opening up the market and that we, as Parliament, will be fully involved in the activities of the Joint Committee.
One only has to look at the positive results for those sectors which have been reformed to see that it is in everyone's interest to adjust policies which fail to redress structural imbalances.
I hope, he concluded, that Ministers will recognise this and deal with it rapidly rather than using it as an opportunity to obtain satisfaction on other matters which have nothing to do with the price package.
The agricultural economy in 1994 Despite some unusual weather conditions which affected the harvest of certain crops (cereals, sugar and wine) and despite difficult market conditions for some products, particularly pigmeat, the situation was definitely better in 1994 than in previous years.
Farm incomes, measured in terms of net value-added at factor cost per annual work unit (AWU), increased considerably, by +5.7% in real terms, in the European Union in 1994.
The provisional figures currently available (likely to be revised in 1995) show an increase of more than 10% in Greece, France, Spain and Portugal.
For cereals, the 1994/95 marketing year started with stocks of 33 million tonnes, of which 18 million t were held in public intervention.
The harvest is put at around 162 milion tonnes, 1 million tonnes down on last year and 19 million t below the 1991 harvest, which was the last normal harvest before the reform.
On the basis of this harvest and the consolidation in the increase in animal consumption of cereals (up 5 to 6 million t in relation to 1992/93), cereals stocks at the end of the marketing year should be down to about 25 million tonnes, with public stocks estimated at about 10 million tonnes.
However, these reductions were partially neutralized on different markets either by the successive devaluations of certain "green rates" or by a relative improvement in market equilibrium or both.
On average for the EU 12 a quarter of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the area (+200 000 ha) and the remainder to a return to normal yields after the drop in 1993.
Unlike oilseeds, areas sown to protein crops (peas, beans and sweet lupins) were down by 4.6% and production by 11% as against 1993, which was an exceptional year in all respects.
With an estimated harvest of around 150 million hl, Community wine production is well below that of 1992 (191 million hl) for the second year running.
In the vegetable sector the market situation has been depressed, even critical for some products, such as cauliflower.
Milk production continued to drop slightly (-0.7%), although with variations from one Member State to another.
The reduction in the dairy herd (-1.1% in 1994) continued, while yields increased by only 0.8%, as against annual increases in excess of 2.5% in recent years.
As in 1993, beef and veal production in 1994 is much lower than it was in 1991.
This continued drop in production together with a steady flow of exports at a high level (1 million tonnes) has resulted in the reduction of physical stocks to about 130 000 tonnes in December 1994 (40,000 tonnes in February 1995) as against 718 000 t at the same time in 1993 and 1.166 million tonnes in 1992.
ECU 1047 less than the guideline.
The impact of the proposals on expenditure is ECU 149 million in a full year.
PROPOSALS Milk: The immediate need for the 2% reduction in quota decided in principle in the reform would appear to have receded, in particular because the policy of gradually reducing the butter price has helped to reduce the decline in butter consumption.
Given the success of this policy, and the fact that dairy farming remains economically very attractive compared with other sectors, the Commission suggests a further 2% reduction in the butter intervention price.
Cereals: It is proposed to reduce the level of the monthly increments by 10% to ECU 1.30/ton per month to reflect the reduction in financing costs arising from the final reduction in cereals prices and the reductions in the level of short term interest rates.
It is also proposed to delay the opening of intervention by two months.
A derived intervention price for Finland is to be fixed at ECU 64.65/100 kg.
Pigmeat: A further reduction is proposed in the basic price, to take account of the reduction in cereals prices.
This proposal forms part of a gradual policy which has been followed over the last few years of trying to move the basic price to a realistic level i.e.
ECU 1509.39/tonne so that it can serve its objective of signalling to producers where prices might be expected to settle in a balanced market.
Currently market prices are significantly below the proposed level of the basic price.
Recovery depends upon an appropriate adjustment by producers in the level of their production.
Dried fodder: No proposal is submitted at this stage.
Tobacco: No changes are proposed in premia or in the regime itself, but some adjustments are proposed in the division of the total Community quota between the different groups of varieties to bring production more in line with the qualities in demand. ----------- COM(95)34 * * *

In particular when we consider the links that there are between Europe and the US with regard to the action that we can take on the global stage, it is even more important now to move forward, despite the difficulties and differences we have had in the past.
Just take a look around the world.
In Afghanistan, we have to work with the US not only to ensure a stabilisation of the situation there, not just for the sake of the country itself, but also because 90% of the heroin being used in Europe at the moment comes from Afghanistan.
Likewise, in South America we must take joint action to ensure that alternative crops can be found for its farmers, because huge amounts of cocaine come from there.
If we look at Darfur in particular, we see the failure of the international community to act and react to the genocide that is taking place there.
It is incumbent on us in Europe to bring the US along in order to take further and stronger action.
Likewise, as today we celebrate World Malaria Day, the actions that we can take collectively are far greater than those we can take individually.
Most importantly of all are the actions of world trade, however, in order to ensure a fair and more equitable society for all.
I call on the Commission and others here to no longer rescind our agreements with other countries in order to protect and assist the poorest in the world.
Together we can achieve more than that which divides us, and in that way we can overcome our political differences on small issues.
– Mr President, after one year I have to say it again: the passive government of Serbia and Montenegro remains responsible for inciting the strained relations, for the assaults suffered by Hungarians, the harassment, robbery, violation of cemeteries and the destruction and abuse of historical monuments of the Hungarian community.
I would like to send a message to the Serbian nation from here in Strasbourg, that it should not allow itself to be a pawn of the hatred against foreigners incited by the post-communist, nationalist elite.
This does not provide a solution – it only causes further suffering.
The Serbian nation should face its past, especially the organised genocide that took place in Vojvodina sixty years ago and had more than 40 thousand Hungarian victims.
The decision is in the hand of the Serbian nation.
Serbia has to decide whether to become a European democracy that is free from discrimination and fear, or the North Korea of Europe.
.
Mr President, the rapporteur has managed to secure a majority for her report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Despite it being a majority, it is striking how many Members abstained from the vote; 20 voted in favour, 7 against and there were no fewer than 19 abstentions.
Needless to say, I was, despite the outcome, very disappointed about that.
I would therefore beg to differ with the previous speakers.
Article 81 of the Treaty stipulates that cooperatives that distort the market are not compatible with Community law.
Paragraph 3 of the same article formulates, however, a number of exceptions which must be met in order to allow those cooperatives to go ahead after all.
On that basis, a block exemption shall apply to the liner trade under Regulation 4056/1986.
The Commission has launched an inquiry into the question to what extent this block exemption is still admitted in 2005.
Are the conditions of Article 81 (3) still being met?
The Commission has reached the conclusion that that is not the case and would thus like to review the rules.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Commission in this, and our Amendment 10, among others, is evidence of this.
In paragraph 9, the rapporteur flags that the four cumulative conditions of Article 81(3) are only partly being met.
At the same time, the rapporteur calls for the enforcement of a cooperative.
This raises some question marks, to put it mildly.
After all, if the conditions are only partly being met, we can quite clearly state that they are not being met, because the four conditions are really cumulative in nature.
The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament were concerned about the impact a possible review may have on the shipping companies of the SME sector.
What businesses are we talking about then?
The likes of Pino Nedlloyd, Hapag Lloyd, APL, MYK?
To include these businesses under the heading of SMEs is, to my mind, going too far.
Nevertheless, the Commission has taken this on board and commissioned a study, among other things, to clarify the impact on the so-called smaller businesses.
This study has now been published and what is the conclusion?
The repeal of the regulation leads to lower transport prices and better service, and smaller shipping companies have not experienced any drawbacks.
This stands to reason, for the SME sector is mainly on the side of the consumers and shippers.
However, if Amendment 17 is anything to go by, both the Group of the European People’s Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament remain unconvinced.
I would like to call on my fellow Member to have another careful look at paragraph 1.
According to the text before us, the objective of the review is to maintain and extend the European line trade sector in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
This strikes me as a misconception.
The objective of this review, as indeed that of the Lisbon Strategy, is to create a competitive climate in which the sector can operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.
It has never been the intention to protect the sector on the basis of improper arguments.
Finally, I should like to ask my fellow Members to have another closer look at the amendments – namely Amendment 1 to 14 – that I have tabled together with the Group of the Greens; I probably did this against my better judgment, but I did it all the same.
In this respect, the Commission does deserve more support than it is currently getting.
Finally, unlike the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner McCreevy’s conclusions.
Brussels, 4 June 2008
The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the proposed takeover of the Reflex paper production mill in Germany, that currently belongs to the Finnish paper manufacturer M-Real, by the French paper manufacturer Arjowiggins, subject to conditions.
The Commission concluded that, with these commitments, the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area (EEA) or a significant part of it.
During its initial investigation, the Commission identified serious concerns with regard to competition on the market for carbonless paper.
Arjowiggins may finalise the transaction only after the divestiture commitments have been fulfilled.
Today's Action Plan is the first step towards a single EU VAT area which is equipped to tackle fraud, to support business and help the digital economy and e-commerce.
© European Union 2016 Director: Barbara Grahek-Lazarevic
The European Commission has presented an Action Plan setting out ways to reboot the current EU VAT system to make it simpler, more fraud-proof and business-friendly.
The current VAT rules urgently need to be updated so they can better support the Single Market, facilitate cross-border trade and keep pace with today's digital and mobile economy.
At the same time, the current VAT system remains fragmented and creates significant administrative burdens, especially for SMEs and online companies.
- key principles for a future single European VAT system;
- short term measures to tackle VAT fraud;
- update the framework for VAT rates and set out options to grant Member States greater flexibility in setting them;
- plans to simplify VAT rules for e-commerce in the context of the Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy and for a comprehensive VAT package to make life easier for SMEs.
Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue said: "
Today, we are starting a dialogue with the European Parliament and the Member States for a simpler and more fraud-proof VAT system in the EU.
This Commission has already proposed clear measures to address corporate tax avoidance, and we will be equally decisive in tackling VAT fraud."
Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, said: "
VAT is a major source of tax revenue for EU Member States.
This is a huge waste of money that could be invested on growth and jobs.
It's time to have this money back.
We are also keen to grant Member States more autonomy on how to define their VAT reduced rates.
Our Action Plan will deliver on each of these points."
Key elements
A future definitive EU VAT system for cross-border trade to reduce opportunities for fraud
The current VAT system needs to be modernised to keep pace with the challenges of today's global, digital and mobile economy.
The current VAT system for cross-border trade which came into force in 1993 was intended to be a transitional system and leaves the door open to fraud.
The Commission therefore intends to come forward in 2017 with a proposal to put in place definitive rules for a single European VAT area.
Immediate measures to tackle VAT fraud under the current rules
Cross-border VAT fraud deprives Member States of vast sums of revenue.
We will continue to closely monitor the performance of tax administrations in collecting and controlling VAT.
More autonomy for Member States to choose their own rates policy
Under the current rules, Member States need to stick to a pre-defined list of goods and services when it comes to applying zero or reduced VAT rates.
The Commission plans to modernise the framework for rates and to give Member States more flexibility in future.
It proposes two options: one option would be to maintain the minimum standard rate of 15% and to review regularly the list of goods and services which can benefit from reduced rates, based on Member States' input.
The second option would abolish the list of goods and services that can benefit from reduced rates.
This would, however, require safeguards to prevent fraud, avoid unfair tax competition within the Single Market and it could also increase compliance costs for businesses.
Under both options, the currently applicable zero and reduced rates would be maintained.
Support for e-commerce and SMEs
The current VAT system for cross-border e-commerce is complex and costly for Member States and businesses alike.
EU businesses are at a competitive disadvantage because certain non-EU traders can import VAT-free goods to the EU.
The complexity of the system also makes it difficult for Member States to ensure compliance.
The Commission will come forward by the end of 2016 with a legislative proposal to modernise and simplify VAT for cross-border e-commerce as part of the Digital Single Market strategy.
This will include a proposal to ensure that e-publications can benefit from the same reduced rates as physical publications.
As a second step, we will present in 2017 a VAT simplification package designed to support the growth of SMEs and to make it easier for them to trade across borders.
Background
The common Value Added Tax (VAT) system plays an important role in Europe’s Single Market.
It was originally put in place to do away with turnover taxes which distorted competition and hindered the free movement of goods and to remove fiscal checks and formalities at internal borders.
It is a major and growing source of revenue in the EU, raising almost EUR 1 trillion in 2014, corresponding to 7% of EU GDP.
One of the EU’s own resources is also based on VAT.
As a consumption tax, it is one of the most growth-friendly forms of taxation.
But the VAT system has been unable to keep pace with the challenges of today's global, digital and mobile economy.
The current VAT system, which was intended to be a transitional system, is fragmented, complex for the growing number of businesses operating cross-border and leaves the door open to fraud: domestic and cross-border transactions are treated differently and goods or services can be bought free of VAT within the Single Market.
The Commission has consistently pressed for the reform of the VAT system.
We have listened to the European Parliament and the Council, which both agreed that any future VAT system should be based on the principle of destination, i.e.: where the goods or services are consumed.
Today's Action Plan is part of the Commission's Better Regulation agenda.
Next Steps
The Commission will ask the European Parliament and the Council, supported by the European Economic and Social Committee, to provide clear political guidance on the options put forward in this Action Plan and to confirm their support for the reforms set out in this Communication.
The Commission will present proposals on all issues in 2016 and 2017.

IP/16/1022
in writing. - (DE) The Reul report is an apology for the nuclear industry.
Flying in the face of common sense, nuclear energy is depicted as the technology of the future, with even more EU research funding and budgetary resources to flow into the development of this high-risk dinosaur technology.
Indeed, despite the recent 'incidents' at Vattenfall's nuclear plants, the focus is on expanding nuclear energy in Europe.
In light of these incidents, it is extremely cynical to claim that nuclear energy generation is becoming 'ever-safer'.
Instead of continuing to invest in this troublesome energy form, with a deliberate failure to address the issue of final storage, a social and ecological revolution should finally be the aim.
This means breaking apart the private monopolies which exist in the nuclear industry, providing a massive injection of funding for renewables and localising energy production.
Given that it is the nuclear companies, in particular, which have initiated a new round of massive price increases, there is an urgent need for action.
The report merely serves the profit interests of Europe's nuclear industry.
The call for new nuclear power plants in Europe is unacceptable.
The legal basis for funding for an indefinite period is to be enshrined in the Reform Treaty.
This is yet another reason to reject the Treaty.
Every additional cent for EU nuclear funding is one too many.
Promoting energy production from renewable resources, solar, wind and hydro power, is the only sustainable energy policy.
Brussels, 31 May 2002
He cited the case of the blue whiting stock which is severely overexploited after years of overfishing as one of the cases where only co-operation among the parties concerned would ensure sustainability in this fishery.
Mr Fischler also presented the Commission proposals for a substantial reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.
"The current situation clearly demonstrates that the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has failed to deliver sustainability in European fisheries.
It is not an exaggeration or mere rhetoric to say that only a deep reform of the CFP will secure the future of our fishermen and fish stocks.
Our reform package aims to achieve sustainable ecological, economic and social fisheries in Europe.
By bringing forward a social action plan for the fishermen concerned, we also live up to our social responsibility".
In a bilateral meeting, Evnegy Nazdratenko, Chairman of the State Committee for Fisheries of the Russian Federation and Commissioner Fischler agreed to envisage launching the formal negociations for a Fisheries Agreement between the Russian Federation and the EU during the second half of July 2002.
A solution would be found, he said, when parties dropped their unrealistic demands, based on catches which have increased threefold from 1998 to 2001.
The EU has, in line with scientific advice, kept catches under its responsibility stable.
"A constructive and responsible approach is urgently required if we are to protect blue whiting.
Fresh scientific advice will be available very shortly from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and I would like to invite coastal states to meet very soon after to agree on the implementation of the multi-annual management plan, signed in December 2001.
We also need to agree on the level of total allowable catches and on the sharing of these catches.
We cannot wait any longer, now is the time to agree on a solution for this stock".
The Russian Federation was represented by the Chairman of the State Committee for Fisheries of the Russian Federation and the European Commission was represented by the Commissioner.
Three themes had been selected for this conference:
the renewal of North-Atlantic fisheries policies and the integration of the ecosystem approach and environmental policy into fisheries management and
research on and management of unregulated species and the role of regional fisheries management organisations in the North-Atlantic.
Participants reviewed a wide range of issues on co-operation in marine research activities and in the application of new technologies, in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, the 1995 Agreement for the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks as well as other international fisheries management instruments.
They also stressed the importance of co-operating in order to meet the common objective of long-term sustainability in the North-Atlantic fisheries and their optimum utilisation.
Improved scientific knowledge of marine ecosystems and the use of new technologies will help achieve this goal, they agreed.
A review of the various fisheries management policy renewal initiatives was undertaken by the participants.
They underlined the importance of integrating the ecosystem approach and environmental considerations in the formulation and implementation of such policies in the North-Atlantic.
Participants stressed the importance of developing measures to manage unregulated species and in particular deep sea species.
It was also important for the various parties to co-operate in research and data collection as well as in the development of management measures for the stocks in areas under the responsibility of Regional Fisheries Organisations, in particular in the Northwest-Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) and the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC).
The European Commission presented some ideas for ensuring progress in this area.
Among the other topics discussed was the development of the North-East Atlantic global ecosystem monitoring in the major fishing areas and in other areas of human activities.
The opportunity of developing and implementing a programme to study the effects of climate change on North-Atlantic ecosystems and major fish stocks was also examined as was the development of an international programme to study the effects of marine mammals on North-Atlantic fish stocks.
Participants recalled the 2001 Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem which stresses that the scientific basis for integration of ecosystem factors into fisheries management needs further development, and that there is incomplete scientific knowledge of the ecosystem structure, functioning, elements and properties, as well as of the ecological effects on fisheries.
In that respect, the participants reaffirmed that certain non-fishery land- and sea-based activities have an impact on the marine ecosystem and have consequences for management.
Background
The coastal states concerned by the blue whiting fishery include the EU, the Faeroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway.
They form part of a twin-track approach whereby the five parties agree beforehand on catch restrictions to be set within their respective waters.
NEAFC subsequently establishes compatible conservation measures for the portion of the stock in international waters.
Successive rounds of negotiations have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough.
(ES) Mr President, President of the European Council, I have two messages: one of concern, and one of demanding encouragement for the work that lies ahead.
Concern over the inadequate nature of the response and that it be genuinely European in scale; concern about the involvement of the International Monetary Fund and the recourse to bilateral loans.
Concern that the response has not been effective enough, with the short-term effect that the Greek debt has increased.
Also, however, concern for the lack of understanding of the fundamental problem, which we here in Parliament have underlined.
Moreover, the Greek problem is a problem for the euro area and, by extension, the entire European Union: the deficit and, consequently, the debt have rocketed as a consequence of the financial rescue plans, which have been extremely expensive.
Therefore, austerity must not put at risk either the investment necessary for economic recovery or the financing of essential reforms.
That is why the second message is of demanding encouragement: because the essential reforms must go hand in hand with a strategy whose importance must not, clearly, diminish in the eyes of Europeans.
Let us, therefore, place the emphasis on renewing the European model that is so important to us: education, yes, and the knowledge society.
In addition, however, a commitment to high-quality employment and, above all, egalitarian employment that will better prepare us to face the future, without neglecting the fight against poverty.
That is why I am calling on you, Mr President of the European Council, to make a commitment that the Council and the Commission will be ambitious in the 2020 strategy - in which this House must also be involved - and measure up to their responsibilities, because it is clear, whatever the case, that Parliament will measure up to its responsibility to the European public, which looks to us.
Commissioner for Energy Günther Oettinger, Prime-Minister of Romania Victor Ponta and the Prime-Minister of the Republic of Moldova Iurie Leancă, will today jointly inaugurate the launch of the works for the realisation of the gas interconnector between Ungheni (West of Moldova) and Iaşi (East of Romania).
Günther Oettinger, EU Commissioner for Energy said today: "
This is a historic day - we are celebrating that Moldova will be directly connected to the EU gas market.
This will enhance its energy security and reduce its dependence from the only supplier it has now."
The 42 km long interconnector is the first and only direct gas pipeline connecting Moldova and the EU.
In conjunction with compressors and a new 130-km-long-pipeline to be built, the new gas interconnector will deliver gas to the capital Chisinau.
For the very first time in history, Moldova will be able to get gas directly from the EU and international markets.
Until now, Moldova is 100% dependent on imported natural gas from Russia and has no domestic gas production.
Since 2010, Moldova is member of the "Energy Community" which aims to extend the EU internal energy market to EU neighbours.
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Ukraine and Kosovo are members.
The EU aims to integrate these countries to the EU market by legislation but also by connecting them physically to the European energy market.

(BG) Madam President, education and science are a priority objective in the 2020 economic strategy.
Whether this programme remains on paper or is translated into action on the ground depends on us.
In order to succeed, both European institutions and Member States need to take responsibility for it.
Instead, the Bulgarian Government is conducting a policy which runs not only counter to national, but also to European policy on scientific research and education.
While Europe has allocated three percent to research and development until 2020, Bulgaria has only reached a modest 0.6 percent.
After a series of failed solutions, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, an institution with more than one hundred and forty years of history, set up under the harsh conditions of Ottoman rule, which now accounts for 55 percent of scientific research in Bulgaria and is recognised all over the world, is to be liquidated.
It has received over EUR 30 million for over 400 successful European projects.
Despite its involvement in European institutions at political and expert level, the Bulgarian Government clearly cannot see the link between science and getting out of the crisis.
The issue must be placed on the agenda of the Council and the Commission.
It is not just a Bulgarian issue, because it puts the fulfilment of the strategic programme and European priorities at stake.
Mr President, if you will permit me, I have a brief comment to make.
At the beginning of the sitting, you welcomed the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament and his colleagues.
As rapporteur, I would like to express my sincere thanks.
The parliament in question, the Sabor, has implemented the laws that we have required with a thoroughness and speed that is truly exemplary.
I am sure that all involved can confirm that, including Mr Hökmark, the Chair of the delegation to the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee.
I would like to add that I implore my fellow Members to back Croatia's application for accession with a large majority in favour.
That would represent a signal not only for Croatia, but for the future of the EU, an expression of faith in this European Union.
That is because if Croatia is to join the Union, it will do so fully aware of our problems, but also aware that this is the future of Europe.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, it is just a few hours since the partisans of Ouattara reached the headquarters of the government and of Ivorian Radio and Television and I want to express my concern, because the risk of clashes and confrontation is clearly significant and absolutely real.
Our first responsibility this evening is to call for calm and dialogue.
However, this is also the responsibility of the main Ivorian leaders.
Both the outgoing President and the President-elect must do all they can to prevent violence breaking out again in a country that has suffered far too much for years.
That is the first message.
The second message is that, from the start, the international community, Europe of course, but also the African Union, have spoken with one voice.
They mobilised to ensure that the result of the election was respected.
This pressure must continue and sanctions must be applied.
Laurent Gbagbo must accept defeat.
Alassane Ouattara must work tirelessly for the reconciliation of his people.
For our part, it is imperative that we do not slacken in our efforts until the situation has stabilised.
I should like to thank you in advance, High Representative, for bearing these messages, especially this evening.
– Mr President, Mr Garot has produced a good report, and it is to his credit that he has brought the price of produce back to the centre of the debate.
Decoupling has facilitated the removal of the twofold price distortions brought about by payments, which tended to keep prices down and thus gave customers the opportunity to get their hands on cheap raw materials, in that the linking of grants to production – which was itself unequally distributed – meant that between 75% and 80% of this State aid was claimed by between 20% and 25% of farms.
Now, even though decoupling is in place – and it was the right step to take – it does not automatically follow that different power relations have come into being; rather, what matters is that prices should be actively negotiated.
This is not just about the distributing chains, but also about the cooperatives, some of them managed by farmers, which pursue their price and market policies in decision-making bodies, and it is about better payments for raw materials – agricultural raw materials.
You have also made it clear that we now have to talk about modulation and about different ways of distributing these funds.
Modulation must link the practice of some large and rationalised farming enterprises receiving from the state a premium amounting to EUR 100 000 per worker, to the number of employees and also to the type of production.
From this, quality criteria must be developed, in order that state funds do not contribute to the accumulation of assets and give the wrong stimuli to production, but instead, enable the continuation of rural production methods in Europe.
deputising for the author. - Mr President, like Mr Caspary, I welcome the three preference regimes we have under the GSP - Everything But Arms, GSP and GSP+.
It is right that the 49 poorest countries in the world should get open access to our markets for everything but their arms.
It is right, as Mr Caspary has said, that the 176 developing countries should be given preferential access to our market.
It is also right that 16 countries should get even better access to our market, through GSP+, in return for setting up and implementing 27 specified international conventions on human rights, co-labour standards, sustainable development and good governance.
However, it is also right that we expect those 16 beneficiary countries to apply and respect their commitments under those conventions.
If we allow countries to get away with not applying their commitments or respecting the laws under those conventions, then we lose the incentive that GSP+ is supposed to give.
That is not all, as we in effect punish the other GSP countries by eroding their preferences and giving preferences to 16 countries not respecting their rights.
That is why I welcome the fact that Sri Lanka has been investigated by the Commission, which has also proposed action against Sri Lanka.
That is also why I believe strongly that the Commission should launch an investigation into Colombia's respect or otherwise of the 27 conventions.
That does not mean that we would take action against Colombia.
It simply means that we would investigate it, as we did with El Salvador but decided that there was no need for action.
I have three questions for the Commissioner.
Does the Commission accept that, in the future, Parliament should be given the right to call for investigations under GSP+?
Secondly, in the meantime, will the Commission present to Parliament the requested report on the status of the ratification and implementation of the conventions by the existing GSP+ beneficiaries?
Finally, when does the Commission plan to transmit to Parliament the revised regulation for the next phase of GSP?
We were promised it by June and we would like to see it delivered by June.
- Madam President, can I just add my sympathy, as others have this evening, to the families who are deeply and sadly affected by this storm, and offer my support for calls for greater flexibility in the Solidarity Fund.
But there is a wider question as well to which I would draw your attention.
It is not as grave as what you are discussing here but in all Member States there are occasional natural disasters and I think of counties that I represent - Offaly, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Laois" \o "County Laois" and Louth - where there was very unnatural and unseasonal flooding.
A small number of families were deeply affected by it, not enough for anyone to notice, but they will suffer serious consequences.
Perhaps we need to look at funding under rural development or the common agricultural policy and establish a hardship fund to look after cases like this which are there and which need assistance.
Brussels, 15 July 2007
Some of the existing medicines block the effect of this enzyme after the process has taken place.
Thanks to these latest findings, published today in leading scientific magazine Nature, scientists will now be able to tailor new molecules that block LTC4 before it can act.
The two projects, named EICOSANOX and E-MeP are headed by professors from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and one, EICOSANOX has one Nobel-Prize winning scientist in its team.
Together, the two projects received €20m of funding from the EU's Sixth Research Framework Programme.
Inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), arteriosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma, are serious endemic, disabling and sometimes fatal illnesses.
They cause tremendous human suffering and are an increasing burden on European societies and health care systems.
For some of these diseases, important underlying mechanisms and mediators have been identified.
Thus, human bronchial asthma and hay fever may be caused by over production of leukotrienes.
During an asthmatic attack, an inflammatory reaction develops in the respiratory system, which leads to narrowing of the airways, the gathering of fluid in the body, especially lungs, and mucus secretion.
Asthma medicines often aim at blocking the downstream effects of LTC4 synthase.
However, there is a need for new pharmaceutical alternatives, since not all patients respond to the existing medicines.
This greater clarity of the structure of the enzyme means that scientists now have a much better understanding of how it is formed and how it works.
This knowledge can then be used to develop more effective therapies.
Scientists from around the world have been working on unravelling the structure of LTC4 synthase and the results of two such projects are described in Nature this week.
In addition to the €20 million given to these two projects, a further €24 million should be allocated before the beginning of the year.
Journalists interested in speaking to the project teams should contact:
Professor Pär Nordlund (par.nordlund@ki.se or +46 704336688)
No major logistical problems were reported, and in fact in most Member States the level of preparation proved better than anticipated.
A higher than expected percentage of ATMs dispensed euros as of day one, and the number of ATM cash withdrawals was much higher than normal.
Public reaction was positive throughout the countries of the euro area.
In at least nine of the twelve participating states most ATMs will dispense small-denomination notes, in line with the Commission's recommendations.
In the Netherlands, for example, there were almost 3 million withdrawals in the course of the day; in Germany there were more than 4 million, and in France more than 3 million.
The value of withdrawals often tended to be higher than usual too.
In Italy withdrawals totalled �184 million, in France �180 million, and in Austria 40 million.
In Italy, for example, over three-quarters of them have been converted to take the euro.
National currencies are being returned to the central banks quickly.
For example, in the Netherlands and Belgium the proportion of national banknotes already handed in is between 16% and 30%.
The people of Europe are easing themselves into their new currency.
So far the changeover is proving to be a smooth and good-humoured operation.
Brussels, 8 December 2009
In September last, 34 Master's level translation programmes from universities all over Europe were selected to be members of the EMT network for an initial period of four years.
A further call will be launched at the end of 2010.
With the EMT network, a quality label for translation programmes at Master’s level is born.
The EMT project is the first one to take on board all these elements.
In this first meeting, the participants are electing t he EMT network board and setting up three working groups .
On the second day, u niversities whose applications were unsuccessful in the first call will also be invited to contribute to the development of the project.
They will acquire language and intercultural competences , including the ability to summarise texts and understand presuppositions or allusions, etc.
A recording of the conference can be viewed on:
http://scic.ec.europa.eu/str/basic/charduri/
The conference can be viewed on 8 December from 9:30 to 16:00 and on 9 December from 9:30 to 12:00 and from 15:00 to 17:30.
The list of the translation programmes selected in the network is available on:
http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/programmes/emt/network/index_en.htm .

in writing. - I voted for this report on the basis of expert reports which say that at this moment, both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner.
This Council differs from the ministerial meetings held in Nantes (1989), Turin (1990), The Hague (1991) and Lisbon (1992) in two ways: - it is the first time that the Ministers concerned are meeting in an informal specialist council (the previous meetings did not have this status); - it is the first time that the new Article 146 of the Treaty is being applied.
The Council will be chaired on behalf of Belgium by a regional minister, Mr Guy Spitaels, Minister-President of the Walloon Region.
This Council is being held at an important moment in the implementation of the new programming period for the Community Structural Funds, between the adoption of the revised rules in July 1993 and the negotiations on the future Community support frameworks which will take place over the coming months.
Mr Millan will present working papers on each of these three points.
The Presidency will formulate the conclusions of the Council in a communiqué.
THE MAIN POINTS OF MR MILLAN'S SPEECH I. The completion of the first programming period and the lessons learned Overall implementation of the CSFs in 1989-93 followed the lines planned and at the end of this period the vast bulk of the available commitment appropriations will have been utilized.
While at the beginning of the programming period, the main fear was of problems with Objective 1, in practice the pace of implementation of assistance under Objectives 2 and 5(b) has experienced more difficult problems than those arising from the implementation of Objective 1.
It is true that some measures, such as those for energy, have not been as successful as was hoped; however, the regional programmes in which local interest is greatest are being implemented with encouraging results.
Indeed, some major facilities (transport and telecommunications) are making very positive progress and their impact in development terms is promising; - in the case of the French overseas departments, implementation of the CSFs for this period will prove acceptable in view of the particularly severe structural handicaps.
Here too, it is true, installation of certain major facilities (ports, airports, water works, etc.) has been delayed.
The appropriations not utilized will reinforce other measures such as drainage works, water supply and road projects, all of which are contributing to the same development objectives.
Objectives 2 and 5(b) As far as Objectives 2 and 5(b) are concerned, some delays in commitment were noted at the beginning of this year.
There were particular problems in implementing the Objective 2 programmes in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and the Objective 5(b) programmes in Italy and Belgium.
The multiannual programming technique presupposes a strategic approach to development which should result in selectivity and greater coherence in the measures financed by the Community.
It cannot be denied that over the period in question this change has not yielded all the benefits expected.
The objectives to be achieved have not been adequately specified or quantified.
2.
The regions and the Member States do not always have the technical and administrative capacities needed to implement all the operations planned in a limited time.
Significant progress has been made in this regard.
3.
The Commission would also point out the great difficulty it has encountered during this period in guaranteeing the correct application of the principle of additionality.
While verification has been carried out under acceptable conditions in certain Member States which have received substantial transfers, this has not been the case in several others, where the information available has been unsatisfactory or too fragmentary to provide assurance that the Funds have really increased the overall development effort.
4.
The results of the efforts made to dovetail loans and grants more smoothly have so far remained disappointing.
For example, the direct association of the EIB in implementation of the CSFs has remained limited.
5.
In general terms, a modulation of mechanisms depending on the volume of resources deployed or the nature of assistance has often been proposed.
Conclusions The assessment of measures undertaken must take account of the principle of subsidiarity, which ensures a clear division of roles between the Community level and the national and regional levels.
The principle of subsidiarity makes it regrettable that operators at the local level have not been more closely associated with Community structural measures, particularly in those areas which are of particular concern to them.
Finally it should be emphasized that the search for greater integration of assistance from different Funds is too often impeded by administrative rigidities at national and Community level.
Similarly, the complexity of the financial circuits in certain Member States is the cause of the sometimes very long delays in payment noted in the financial implementation of programmes.
These various points of assessment should not hide the crucial importance of the roles which the Funds and the EIB lending instruments have played over recent years in the development of the regions, not to mention their visible macro-economic impact, particularly in Portugal, Ireland and Greece.
II.
PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT PROGRAMMING PERIOD The Commission believes that the new rules on the Structural Funds provide an appropriate legal framework for increasing the effectiveness of Community structural measures.
The designation of areas eligible under Objectives 2 and 5(b) The success of the revision of the rules now depends on a correct and rigorous application of these provisions in the preparation of new financing operations.
The first stage in this process is the designation of the areas eligible under Objectives 2 and 5(b).
In accordance with the new procedure laid down in the revised regulations, all the Member States concerned have sent their proposed lists of areas which they consider should benefit from Community assistance under Objective 2 or 5(b).
The Commission, acting in partnership with each of the Member States concerned, will ensure the coherence and concentration required.
The preparation of the plans The preparation of plans by the Member States and the regions is a crucial stage in the new programming period.
The next generation of Community support frameworks, which the Commission will adopt through the partnership in agreement with the Member States, should also be more complete and provide more information than earlier ones.
From that time on, however, the Commission began a programme of ex ante or continuous assessments of all the CSFs for Objectives 1, 3 and 4 and a representative sample of the main CSFs for Objectives 2 and 5(b).
A very large number of assessment studies covering the twelve Member States have been carried out over the last few years.
Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that an overall judgement on this work cannot be wholly positive.
It remains difficult to evaluate the direct link between the amount of Community funds committed and the realisation of the objectives set out.
This lack of information led to a considerabe strengthening of the requirements concerning the contents of the regional plans under the new Regulations.
This includes defining at the level of the major priorities or the various operational programmes the battery of indicators of physical implementation, direct effects or socio-economic or environmental impact which underlie a rational process of ex post monitoring and assessment of the measures adopted.
The growing economic crisis in Europe and its budgetary and social consequences mean that greater economic efficiency in the utilization of Community grants must be sought.
Since assessment entails appraisal of the effective of measures, it is a technical tool to assist decision- making at political level in order to secure the best possible results from the resources available.
A second phase began with the presentation of a new work programme which includes the publication at the end of 1994 of a new "Europe 2000" document to incorporate the results of trans-regional and external impact studies and an analysis of policies for the organization and management of territory within the Community.
Turning to priorities for the future, Mr Millan set out guidelines for the part-financing of pilot projects in the field of planning with particular emphasis on exchanges of experience, information on methodologies and assessment practices by the Member States and the Commission.
He also looked at cooperation in this field with non-member countries, particularly the applicants for accession, the members of the EEA and the Mediterranean countries. * * *
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you, once again, for your attention.
The price crisis in 2007-2008 highlighted the weak position of consumers with regard to price volatility.
The agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal.
Why?
Because the upward trend in agricultural prices was portrayed by many as sustainable, and because farmers without doubt invested far too much in 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 - far too much because a delay has built up since the beginning of the 2000s.
On several occasions, Commissioner, you have expressed a desire to no longer intervene in market regulation in the same way.
But have we failed to remember over the last 20 years that agricultural commodities are primarily food products and that we need a certain degree of price stability at both ends of the chain?
Price stability is required at consumer level, on the one hand, because, due to other financial commitments such as mortgages, parenting and leisure activities, the consumer does not have enough leftover income to cope with price fluctuations.
At producer level, on the other hand, price stability is required because business activity involves significant capital, which requires heavy investment.
Organisation within the sectors that includes all the elements of the supply chain, as well as the new players - I am referring to the mass catering sector and processing companies for quick-frozen or even fresh-prepared products - can undoubtedly lead to the introduction of private tools for stabilising prices.
Do you think it is possible to find a way forward with this, Commissioner, and is the Commission ready to participate in such discussions?
The EIB supports seawater desalination in Gaza - Strong presence at the Sixth World Water Forum
Outside the EU, the EIB has channelled more than EUR 2 bn (2007-2011) into investments across the entire field of water management and adaptation to climate change in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region, the ACP countries, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia.
A number of these contributions are published on the Forum's "Platform of Solutions" and will be incorporated in the conclusions and recommendations.
During the Forum, the EIB will play a central role in three debates with high-level experts from its operational directorates:
Since the COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009, the EIB has been working closely with the European development finance institutions to improve the effectiveness of climate change adaptation measures and determine the best methods of financing them.
Exploitation of non-conventional resources , such as the re-use of treated water for farming or industrial purposes or seawater desalination.
The CMI, of which the EIB and the World Bank are co-founders, is a platform for providing technical assistance to enhance public policies in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region in a number of areas, including the water sector.
The CMI is a prime example of a multi-partner approach which helps to broaden views and identify innovative solutions (see: www.cmimarseille.org ).

(ET) Organ transplants must take place quickly.
No more than a couple of hours must elapse between removal and transplantation.
Therefore public awareness and public opinion play an important role in increasing organ donation.
Organ donation and transplantation are medical procedures, and in order for them to be further developed there must be full public involvement and greater public awareness.
The most effective means of increasing public readiness would appear to be improving knowledge of transplant issues among the public and the media.
This must be the first step.
Secondly, I would like to emphasise that, given that there is currently no European coordination of organ exchange, making an improvement in that area is very important, specifically with regard to coordination of the system for organ exchange such as it currently exists between the Member States, for example through a European donor card or a European hotline.
in writing. - After some consideration and serious doubts with the word "fully” in paragraph 8, I have voted in favour of paragraphs 8 and 10 of the Prodi report, as on balance I feel there is a need for an EU framework directive in the area of soil protection to fill in the gaps.
Such a proposal needs to be in "accordance with the principles of better lawmaking” fully respecting the subsidiarity principle; so tomorrow, I will support the Gutiérrez-Cortines proposal for a proportionate EU directive which restores subsidiarity, removes duplication of obligations and is overall, a better balance than the Commission's proposal on soil protection.
With 300 soil types in Europe, only 9 Member States with national legislation in place, and the challenge of climate change before us, there is added value in an even-handed EU approach in addressing the international challenges caused by deforestation and decline in water quality, serious soil erosion, floods and landslides and ensuring safe food production.
– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Titley on his initiative in drafting this report on a subject which brings Europe close to its citizens and by protecting the very valuable gift of life and health.
The eCall system proves that the European Union can give added value to the measures applied by the Member States to prevent and deal with accidents and their multi-dimensional consequences, especially when we think, as has been said, that this system could save approximately 2 500 lives a year, reduce the seriousness of injuries and help to save billions of euros in the overall cost of the consequences.
Several Member States signed the memorandum of understanding, as the rapporteur said, and I am delighted that my country, Greece, is one of them.
However, cooperation must be extended to the whole of the European Union by 2009 if we are to have a single emergency number, with the facility to locate the scene of the accident.
However, if this ambitious but very humane plan is to be implemented, real support is needed – as my honourable friends have said – from the automotive industry, from citizens themselves and from government departments, so there is good cooperation as regards the cost of implementing this plan and cooperation with the rescue and emergency services and, of course, with all the systems, such as the Galileo system: this means that we can make use of all the technology and the achievements of the European Union, not only for economic reasons, in the broadest sense, but also on matters which affect citizens' lives.
Brussels, 19 May 2011
Commission asks ten Member States to implement the Directive aimed at improving safety of European railways
The European Commission has sent a reasoned opinion to ten Member States formally requesting to fully implement the last amendment to the Railway Safety Directive.
The Commission has set a two-month deadline for these Member States to remedy the situation.
Should the Member States fail to do so, the Commission may refer the cases to the Court of Justice.
The EU rules
The aim of the Directive 2008/110/EC is to improve the level of safety of the European rail transport system.
An essential provision of the Directive is that the certificate granted to an ECM is valid throughout the European Union.
The reason for today's action
Directive 2008/110/EC has not yet been transposed, or has been transposed only partially, by ten Member States: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Sweden and United Kingdom.
The practical effect of non-implementation
This will affect not only those countries that have not implemented Directive 2008/110/EC but the whole European single railway area as well.
The next step
For more information on EU infringement procedures, see MEMO/11/312
Mr President of the Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, one of the tasks of your Commission will be to continue the process of EU enlargement.
This process involves an assessment of whether a candidate country respects human rights and whether it is transparent and free from corruption.
I have serious doubts as to whether your Commission will be able to carry out this task well.
I therefore feel bound to ask whether a Commissioner who has clearly shown that he does not understand, or does not wish to understand, the European system of human rights of which we are so proud, can be entrusted with carrying out an assessment of the extent to which human rights are respected in Romania, Bulgaria, and maybe even in Turkey.
I have a second question to put to you too, Mr Barroso.
The formation of your Commission is also a lesson in European democracy, and a lesson that citizens throughout the European Union are observing closely.
What kind of a message are you currently sending out to citizens?
Why, that the opinion of the European Parliament need not be taken into account.
Is this a positive message?
Does it bring the European Union closer to its citizens?
Is it the right kind of message to send out two days before the European Constitution is signed?
Mr Barroso, please listen to what the European Parliament has to say, rather than fighting against it.
Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Jędrzejewska for her firm management of this text, which has provided a clear message that we can take into the negotiations.
She is right in saying that the multiannual financial framework for the EU's budget is now so tight that a lot of promises will be very difficult to fulfil.
We can say that in previous years we have been able to find unused funds from the agriculture budget, but there is not that much in unused funds any more.
We need to be able to follow up on the 2020 growth strategy and to invest in joint energy projects and in joint transport projects, we need to be able to invest in young people and in research and we need to be able to finance a strong and joint External Action Service.
I am also very much in agreement with Commissioner Hedegaard that we need to ensure that there is sufficient payment into the Structural Funds to enable us to fulfil our promises to the new Member States.
We desperately need the promised mid-term review of the budget so that we can be clear about how we can finance new needs.
Strangely enough, we are now seeing more and more examples of Member States wanting to pay.
They just do not want to pay via the EU budget.
We see this, for example, in the establishment of the three new financial supervision agencies that are intended to protect us from future financial crises in the EU.
They are to be paid for both by the Member States directly and out of the EU budget.
If the whole of the expenditure were to be taken from the EU budget, the multiannual financial framework would burst!
However, it is, of course, a lot more bureaucratic and cumbersome to collect money directly from the Member States and it gives us a poorer overview, less control and a poorer ability to monitor the situation.
This is a very negative development.
So, should we not make savings in the EU budget?
Yes, of course we also need to be thrifty during times of crisis, but I simply want to say that if all Member States had pursued their budget policies like the EU budget there would not have been any deficits and there would not have been any problems with debt, because the EU budget has ceilings and a rigid framework.
There is no possibility of creating problems.
Thus, perhaps the national authorities should learn from the EU and consider whether this is something they could use at national level too.
(PL) Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak.
This discussion, today, is about cooperation between NATO and the Union.
Mrs Ashton has given us, here, a positive assessment, but I want to say that, in my opinion, it is an assessment which is greatly exaggerated.
My fellow Members from Poland, Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Lisek, have already spoken, and I want to say clearly that I agree with their evaluation.
This is only the beginning, and it is the beginning of a very long road.
In relation to this, I would like to draw attention to three pragmatic aspects where we can see common progress.
The first area concerns the joint defence planning of NATO and the European Union - here it is clear that more can be done.
The second area should concern cooperation between intelligence services - here, too, progress can be made.
Lastly, the third matter concerns the operation of combat groups - the question needs to be asked as to whether, today, they give added value.
The Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 – Frequently Asked Questions
This MEMO explains the new Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union for the years 2014-2020.
It also provides useful tables and charts.
It complements the press release with the highlights of the future budget.
What is the Multiannual Financial Framework?
The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) lays down the maximum annual amounts ('ceilings') which the EU may spend in different political fields ('headings') over a period of no less than 5 years.
The upcoming MFF covers seven years: from 2014 to 2020.
The MFF as such is not the budget of the EU for seven years.
It provides a framework for financial programming and budgetary discipline, ensuring that EU spending is predictable.
It also allows the EU to carry out common policies over a period that is long enough to make them effective.
What precisely did the EP vote upon today?
Today, the European Parliament gave its consent to the regulation laying down the MFF and voted on a number of related issues.
As required by the Treaty, the MFF must be adopted by the Council by unanimity after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament (requiring an absolute majority of all its members).
The MFF package voted today comprises the following documents:
MFF Regulation (MFFR) : A set of rules and provisions specifying the structure and the functioning of the overall mechanism of the Multiannual Financial Framework
See: http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/2060418/st11655.en13.pdf
Inter-institutional Agreement (IIA) : The purpose of the agreement, adopted in accordance with Article 295 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), is to implement budgetary discipline and improve the functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and cooperation between the institutions on budgetary matters as well as to ensure sound financial management.
http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st11/st11298.en13.pdf
Declarations on
Improving effectiveness of public spending in matters subject to EU's action
Gender mainstreaming
Youth unemployment and strengthening research
National management declarations
Review/revision of the MFF
Beyond these elements voted today, the MFF also comprises the decision on EU own resources (income to the EU budget) and the legal bases for the individual funding programmes defining the conditions of eligibility and the criteria for the allocation of funds.
On a large number of programmes however political agreement has already been found in the parallel negotiations since 2011.
So, in many cases the new programmes are only waiting for the final numbers.
In some others, the negotiations are still under way.
For an overview of the latest status quo on sectorial negotiations, please consult the following web page: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/programmes/index_en.cfm
Has the decision on own resources already been adopted?
The Own Resources Decision (ORD) and related implementing measures are still under negotiation.
It will be adopted by the Council after the EP has submitted an opinion, presumably in the course of 2014.
It will come into force only after ratification by all Member States in accordance with their constitutional requirements.
While it covers the same period, the Own Resources Decision is legally not linked to the MFF regulation.
Will the current MFF remain unchanged until 2020?
The functioning of the MFF 2014-20 will be reviewed by the Commission in 2016 taking full account of the economic situation at the time as well as the latest macroeconomic projections.
Will beneficiaries be able to receive funding from the new programmes as of January 2014?
The political intention is to have the new programmes up and running as soon as possible at the beginning of 2014.
This will largely depend on the state of negotiations and the specificities of the management modes of each funding programme.
What is the structure of MFF and its content?
The MFF is divided into six categories of expenditure ('headings') corresponding to different areas of EU activities:
1.
Smart and Inclusive Growth
1a.
Competitiveness for growth and jobs: includes research and innovation; education and training; trans-European networks in energy, transport and telecommunications; social policy; development of enterprises etc.
1b.
Economic, social and territorial cohesion: covers regional policy which aims at helping the least developed EU countries and regions to catch up, strengthening all regions' competitiveness and developing inter-regional cooperation.
2.
Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources: includes the common agricultural policy, common fisheries policy, rural development and environmental measures.
3.
Security and citizenship: includes justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and asylum policy, public health, consumer protection, culture, youth, information and dialogue with citizens.
4.
Global Europe: covers all external action ("foreign policy") by the EU such as development assistance or humanitarian aid.
The European Development Fund also provides financial resources for the ‘EU as a global actor’.
However, it is not part of the EU budget and therefore does not fall under the MFF.
5.
Administration: covers the administrative expenditure of all the European institutions, pensions and European Schools.
6.
Compensations: a temporary cash flow mechanism designed to ensure that Croatia, who joined the EU in July 2013, does not contribute more to the EU budget than it benefits from it in the first year following its accession.
They limit the amounts of money that may be spent from the EU budget in these six policy areas and overall over the whole 2014-20 period.
There are two types of expenditure ceilings:
1.
An annual ceiling for each heading , expressed in commitment appropriations ( legally binding promises to spend money which will not necessarily be paid out in the same year but may be disbursed over several financial years);
2.
An overall annual ceiling:
The overall ceiling is also expressed as a percentage of the EU's estimated GNI.
How will the quality of spending be ensured?
The quality of spending will for example ensured through the following measures:
A clear result-orientation across policy areas will be instrumental to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 growth strategy;
Simplification of policies and programmes will make them more user-friendly and less prone to errors;
New Financial Instruments can increase the impact of EU funding by attracting private capital through leverage effects;
A new Performance Reserve will incentivise outstanding performance of projects by rewarding them under cohesion policy, rural development and the fisheries fund.
What happens if there are unexpected situations?
The new MFF will allow for more flexibility to react to unexpected situations:
Flexibility for payments : under certain conditions and within the overall ceilings set in the MFF, unused payment appropriations and margins can be carried-over from one financial year to the next.
Such adjustments must be offset by a corresponding reduction of the payment ceiling for year n-1.
Flexibility for commitments in growth and employment : commitment appropriations left unused in 2014-17, will form a reserve for additional expenditure in 2016-20 in the area of growth and employment (in particular for youth employment).
For example, the Emergency Aid Reserve was mobilised in 2012 following events such as the outbreak of conflict in Syria, the conflicts in Mali and the drought in the Sahel.
The Flexibility instrument has for example been used in 2009 to contribute to the financing of energy projects in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan and to the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria.
For example, it supported Belgian workers after the General Motors Antwerp plant closed-down.
Own resources
How will the future MFF be financed?
In February 2013, the European Council agreed on some changes to the own resources system for the period 2014-20.
However, the current system remains in force until a new Council Decision on own resources is formally adopted and ratified .
In general, and without prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing legislative procedure, the following principles will be applied under the next Own Resources Decision:
The current financing system will be largely 'rolled over'
collection costs (what Member States retain) for traditional own resources (customs duties) will be lowered to 20 % from 25% which means that 80% of amount collected will form revenue to EU budget;
enhanced – albeit very limited – rationalisation of the System of Financial Corrections
In addition, a high-level group is being set up to review the own resources system.
On the basis of the results of this work, the Commission will assess if a new reform of the own resources system is appropriate.
EU own resources are the EU revenue.
Annual expenditure must be completely covered by annual revenue.
The EU budget cannot run a deficit.
The different types of own resources and the method for calculating them are set out in a Council Decision on own resources.
It also limits the maximum annual amounts of own resources that the EU may raise during a year to 1.23 % of the EU gross national income (GNI).
There are three types of own resources:
Traditional own resources : consist mainly of customs duties on imports from outside the EU and sugar levies.
EU Member States keep 25 % of the amounts as collection costs.
Own resources based on value added tax (VAT) : a uniform rate of 0.3 % is levied on the harmonised VTA base of each Member States.
Own resources based on GNI : each Member State transfers a standard percentage of its GNI to the EU.
Although designed simply to cover the balance of total expenditure not covered by the other own resources, this system has become the largest source of revenue of the EU budget.
The new provisions will provide some rationalisation of the current system of financial corrections.
Until the final adoption and ratification of the Own Resources Decision (ORD), the status quo system will continue to apply .
Current correction mechanisms (ORD 2007-2013):
the UK rebate : the UK is reimbursed by 66 % of the difference between its contribution and what it receives back from the budget.
The cost of the UK rebate is divided among EU Member States in proportion to the share they contribute to the EU's GNI.
However, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, who considered their relative contributions to the budget to be too high, pay only 25 % of their normal financing share of the UK correction;
reduced VAT call rates for Austria (0.225 %), Germany (0.15 %), the Netherlands and Sweden (0.1 %).
the UK rebate will continue to apply;

Mr President, a few days ago in Cyprus a terrible, atrocious crime took place.
A father, a mother and their 15-year-old daughter were abducted from their home and shot at close range just outside Nicosia in the unoccupied part of Cyprus.
Five Turkish Cypriots are very strongly suspected of being the assailants in this case.
The Cypriot police issued warrants for their arrest but unfortunately they have managed to cross into the occupied part of Cyprus.
In the occupied part of Cyprus, illegal police are holding them and are protecting them against being handed over to the legal Cypriot police.
I ask you to use your offices, Mr President, to convince the illegal regime in the occupied part of Cyprus, and perhaps also to convince the Turkish Government which is their guardian, to hand them over to the legal police to be tried.
An India-China Axis?
Is a new alignment between India and China rising to balance America’s global power?
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao just completed a four-day visit to India during which 11 agreements were signed, including a comprehensive five-year strategic cooperation pact.
In addition, Wen announced that China would support India’s bid for a permanent seat on an expanded UN Security Council, and opposed the inclusion of Japan, which the United States supports for a Council seat.
With over a third of the world’s population and two of the globe’s highest economic growth rates, an alliance between China and India could be a serious factor in world politics.
While both are developing countries – many of whose people remain impoverished – they also boast impressive capabilities in information age technologies both for civilian and military purposes.
As Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put it during Wen’s visit, “India and China can together reshape the world order.”
The two countries’ recent rapprochement marks a huge change from the hostility that bedeviled their relations following their 1962 war over a disputed border in the Himalayas.
When I first visited India as an American government official in the late 1970’s, I was struck by my Indian hosts’ fixation on gaining equal status with China.
In 1998, when India tested its nuclear weapons, the defense minister referred to China, and then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee spoke of China as India’s number one enemy.
By contrast, on more recent visits to India, I have found my hosts referring to the need to learn from China.
Trade between the two giants has grown from $100 million in 1994 to nearly $14 billion last year, and India’s minister of commerce and industry has predicted that it will double by this decade’s end.
One agreement signed during Wen’s visit was a new set of guiding principles on how to settle boundary disputes between the two countries.
While improved relations and diminished prospects for conflict are welcome, relations between India and China are more complex than they appear at first.
Not long before the visit of the Chinese premier, India hosted US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Ever since President Bill Clinton’s visit to India, but especially under President George W. Bush, the US has moved from relative indifference to India to the development of a strong strategic relationship.
This new approach might have seemed threatened by Al Qaeda’s attacks on America, which led to a strengthening of US relations with Pakistan’s General Parvez Musharaff.
But the US reassured India that they faced a common threat from transnational terrorism, and that the old Cold War pairings of India and Pakistan were outdated.
Secretary Rice made this plain during her March visit, stressing the importance of a strategic relationship, including a willingness to consider trade in high technology, nuclear energy, and co-production of fighter aircraft such as F-16’s and F-18’s.
Shortly after Rice’s visit, the US announced that it would honor a long-standing promise to sell F-16’s to Pakistan.
While the announcement incited Indian protests, they were relatively muted compared to the past.
One reason is that the State Department also issued a statement that America would help India to become a major world power in the twenty-first century, involving both a strategic and economic dialogue.
Several factors underpin this new American attitude toward India. Rhetoric about “the world’s two largest democracies” is not new, but it fits with the Bush administration’s new emphasis on promoting democracy.
The increasing role of the Indian diaspora in the US, particularly in the information industries, also had an influence, as has the rise in bilateral trade accompanying India’s surging economic growth.
Equally important are strategic concerns about transnational terrorism and the rise of Chinese power.
The rise of China is a major factor in the politics of the twenty-first century.
China has tripled the size of its economy in the past two decades, and has been increasing its military strength.
While both India and the US seek trade and good relations with China, both are aware – and wary – of China’s growing strength.
Thus, both seek to hedge their bets, and what better way to do so than by improving their strategic relationship?
Neither country aims to restrain China in the way the “containment” strategy aimed at an aggressive Soviet Union during the Cold War, but both want to create an international structure that does not tempt China to throw its weight around.
India has a 3,000-kilometer border with China, a 2,000-kilometer border with Pakistan (which has been the beneficiary of Chinese military and nuclear assistance), and growing concerns about the security of sea routes in the Indian Ocean over which oil and other trade move.
As one Indian strategist put it to me during a recent visit, “By 2030, we envisage the US, China, and India as the three largest powers in world politics.
We don’t want a China- or a US-dominated world, but if we had to choose, it would be easier for us to live with the latter.”
So, while improvement in India-China relations is welcome, it is unlikely to herald the beginning of an India-China alliance against the US.
Rather, it more likely represents another move in India’s age-old tradition of managing regional balances of power.
– It is exactly one year since the election in Ethiopia, when the people voted en masse for democracy and change.
Through its mission, which I headed, the EU unfortunately had to conclude that the elections did not meet international standards, due to the lack of transparency of the count and, above all, due to the serious violations of human rights that took place.
The main opposition leaders and thousands of people have been arrested and face the death penalty.
What more needs to happen for the Council to take action and impose targeted sanctions on those in charge of the Addis Ababa regime, as it did in the case of Belarus?
What more needs to happen for the Commission and the Council to take action to secure the swift, unconditional release of the detainees?
The EU does make a difference in Addis Ababa.
We must not let the people of Ethiopia down.

Commission proposal on nutrition and health claims to better inform consumers and harmonise the market
The European Commission today adopted a proposed Regulation on nutrition and health claims made on foods, including food supplements.
As consumers have become increasingly concerned about what they eat and how this affects their health, the food industry has responded by providing more detailed nutrition labelling and often making claims about the beneficial effects of certain foods.
The existing EU rules on labelling(1) and nutrition labelling(2), which do not define conditions for the use of nutrition claims and do not allow health claims to be made, are often not properly enforced.
Consumers can therefore be misled by claims that have not been properly substantiated.
The proposed Regulation will give legal security and address these issues by specifying the conditions for the use of nutrition and health claims, prohibiting certain claims and scientifically evaluating the use of claims in relation to the nutritional profile of foods.
No food product will as a consequence be prohibited but claims on food products will have a true meaning for the consumer.
David Byrne, Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, underlined the importance of the proposed Regulation.
“The implementation of this proposal will allow both industry and consumers to benefit from the correct use of claims.
Consumers will receive accurate and meaningful information while food producers will be able to use serious and scientifically substantiated claims as a marketing tool without being drowned out by the many unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims that currently exist on the market.
Furthermore, the creation of a Regulation at EU-level will enable operators to compete on a fair and equal basis in all EU Member States.”
Nutrition claims what am I eating?
There are currently no legally binding conditions regulating the use of these claims.
The proposed Regulation aims to harmonise the use of such claims so that products claiming to be for example “high fibre” have a defined minimum amount of fibre per a defined unit (eg 6 g per 100g).
Furthermore, some claims may be misleading.
For example a product claiming to be “90% fat free” may be stating correct facts but it is still misleading since it implies that it has a low fat content while in reality 10% fat represents a fairly high fat content.
The annexed list of nutrition claims gives an overview of the definitions.
Health claims what does this food do to me?
Health claims refer to what a food or a food component does to the consumer.
It is currently prohibited to make any claims that are misleading to consumers.
Many health claims regarding the role of a nutrient in the body are uncontroversial and well established, such as the claim that calcium plays an important role in strengthening the teeth and bones.
Within three years of the Regulation entering into force, the Commission will make a positive list of such well established claims that will be permitted.
A distinction is made between these well established claims and more novel claims, such as “whole grain may keep your heart healthy/may reduce the risk of heart disease”.
For the latter type, individual scientific evaluation and pre-marketing approval will be required.
Only claims that can be substantiated will be permitted on the EU level after being evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority.
Food operators will thus benefit from the possibility to make a meaningful claim, including promoting a product's possible impact to reduce the risk of diseases.
Consumers will be able to rely on clear and verifiable claims.
Some claims will not be allowed
It clearly follows from this new approach to health claims, that any information about foods and their nutritional value used in labelling, marketing and advertising which is not clear, accurate and meaningful and cannot be substantiated will not be permitted.
Health claims on alcoholic beverages above 1.2 % will also not be allowed since alcohol is known to entail other health and social problems.
Only claims referring to a reduction in alcohol or energy content, will be allowed.
Nutritional profiles: “good diets” and “bad diets”
The basic principle in nutrition is that there are no “good foods” and “bad foods” but rather “good diets” and “bad diets”.
In a long-term varied diet all foods can be included.
However, foods bearing a claim will automatically be perceived as "good" foods by consumers.
Furthermore, claims about the benefit of consuming a certain product may lead consumers to eat too much of something that should only make up a small part of a good diet.
It is therefore necessary to restrict the use of claims on some foods based on their nutritional profile.
The amount of total fat, saturates, sugar or salt are criteria for the nutritional profile of products, since scientific evidence shows a link between over-consumption of such nutrients and some chronic diseases (in particular WHO report of March 2003).
Within 18 months of adoption of the Regulation, the Commission will evaluate nutritional profiles in close consultation with stakeholders and based on the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and in conjunction with the Member States in the Standing Committee for the Foodchain and Animal Health.
Exemptions may be necessary for certain claims on foods depending on their role and importance in the diet of the population.
Further steps
The draft Regulation will need the approval of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
It is foreseen to come gradually into force by 2005.
Annex
Nutrition claims and conditions applying to them
LOW ENERGY
A claim that a food is low in energy, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product contains less than 40 kcal (170 kJ)/100g and less than 20kcal (80kJ)/100ml.

However, claims expressed as “X% fat-free” shall be prohibited.
In the case of foods naturally low in saturated fat, the term “naturally” may be used as a prefix to this claim.
SATURATED FAT FREE
LOW SUGARS
In the case of foods naturally low in sugars, the term “naturally” may be used as a prefix to this claim.
SUGARS-FREE
In the case of foods naturally sugars-free, the term “naturally” may be used as a prefix to this claim.
WITH NO ADDED SUGARS

INCREASED (NAME OF THE MACRONUTRIENT)
A claim stating that the content in one or more nutrients has been increased, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product meets the conditions for the claim “source of” and the increase in content is at least 30% compared to a similar product.
REDUCED (NAME OF THE NUTRIENT)
LIGHT/LITE
A claim stating that a product is “light” or “lite”, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, shall follow the same conditions as those set for the term “reduced”; the claim shall also be accompanied by an indication of the characteristic(s) which make the food “light” or “lite”.
(1)Directive 2000/13/EC on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foods
(2)Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling on foodstuffs
(3)Directive 96/8/EC on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction
(ES) Madam President, I abstained because I think that the decision to create a unitary patent through enhanced cooperation is another failure by the Council.
There is only agreement between nine Member States and the document itself acknowledges that the objectives cannot be achieved within a reasonable timescale.
Competitiveness?
Efficiency?
In addition, the judgment of the Court of Justice on jurisdiction in terms of the language rules is pending.
The Council should have made the effort to reach a common position, and perhaps it should have done more work on using a single language, taking into account the number of registrations and the language used in the majority of them, in order to make us more competitive in our global context.
Once again, the national perspective of the Member States has resulted in a fragmented decision with no clear criteria regarding the use of three languages.
If we implement measures such as this, we shall never make progress in consolidating the European project.
Mr President, I would like to wind up the discussion on the Boogerd-Quaak report.
This is not about the committee’s political assessment or otherwise; the question is whether or not the Rules of Procedure have been breached.
Since freedom of expression is a significant matter, which is very important to us, we would like this matter to be dealt with seriously and for it to continue to be debated.
I therefore believe – and I am, of course, speaking on behalf of my group – that the report should be referred back to committee.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at midday today (15 February 2011).
Written statements (Rule 149)
(PL) I abstained from voting on the composition of the European Commission, because alongside the good candidates, there were many weak and very weak ones.
It is unacceptable to me to consent to people being put forward for the positions of head of European diplomacy, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs who are not qualified to hold these positions.
We should remember that we are still in a crisis, and we are still looking for a way out of the crisis.
Europe cannot, therefore, afford to have Commissioners who are only now going to learn their portfolios.
I am astonished by the attitude of the President of the European Commission, who, after serving a five-year term of office and having such large experience in leading the Commission, has proposed such weak candidates.
Quite honestly, I should have voted against the proposed make-up of the Commission, but alongside the weak candidates there were also several very good ones - including the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
In spite of my abstention, I wish the entire Commission nothing but success, because this is so important for all Europeans.
Although the EU Treaty clearly prohibits cartels and other infringements of competition law, it is still difficult for affected consumers in the European Community to claim their rights to compensation.
In Romania, for example, a cartel set up in the cement industry was recently fined several million euro.
However, the current legislation in force does not oblige authorities with the powers to monitor competition to get involved in compensation for victims.
I would like to stress the need for these authorities to take into consideration the compensation paid or which should be paid when they calculate the fines imposed on companies which are found guilty of abuses, so as to prevent discrepancies between the harm caused and the punitive measures applied, and especially to ensure damages are paid to those affected by such practices.
This is why I welcome the Commission's intention to improve the methods for guaranteeing the rights of consumers affected by infringement of the law throughout Europe.
Parliament stated very clearly that there must not be any 'opt-out' system in Europe.
Therefore, the victims must be identified as quickly as possible at the time a complaint is made.
The 'opt-in' system guarantees that victims affected by the infringement of competition law will actually be compensated.
Parliament does not want anyone else, be it lawyers, trade associations or the Consumer Protection Office, to benefit as a result of private actions.
I also believe that Parliament is adding a new important element which the Commission's proposal has omitted.
Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are in many cases much more effective for victims who are entitled to compensation than judicial procedures.
I am referring to the fact that at the time when compensation is being sought, settlements must be initiated first of all outside the courts.
They are much less costly than private actions as consumers will be compensated for the losses suffered much more quickly.
Mr President, I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism.
Terrorists do not respect human life, they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights.
We are all behind that fight, but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon.
The American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism.
Unfortunately, the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations.
The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists.
I am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how, by making the wrong decisions, governments can strengthen terrorist organisations.
As an example, the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions, but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again.
The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully.
The interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe.
The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations.
If we are going to fight terrorism, we must all work together within the law.
The committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months.
I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion.
However, the American Government must implement new strategies if it is going to win the war against international terrorism.
There are so many examples of how not to do it, but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated.
The Fed’s Dangerous New Strategy
NEW YORK – On August 27, the US Federal Reserve issued a press release summarizing updates to its longer-run goals and monetary-policy strategy, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell discussed the revisions at greater length in a speech later the same day.
The two documents are a collection of type I and type II errors. If the Fed were to pursue the new strategy determinedly, it could inflict real economic damage on the United States and the world.
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year. From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
Let’s begin with a minor error of omission. In his speech, Powell referred to the Fed’s congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability – omitting, as is the norm, its third congressionally mandated objective of moderate long-term interest rates.
The obvious tool for managing long-term rates is yield-curve control, but the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) does not mention this instrument even in the context of pursuing maximum employment and stable prices.
But the real trouble starts with the FOMC’s reinterpretation of “maximum employment.”
The press release states that the committee’s policy decision will be informed by its “assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.”
The FOMC’s original strategy statement, adopted in 2012, referred to “deviations from its maximum level.”
This new asymmetric interpretation is extremely worrying.
It suggests either that maximum employment is achieved only when every working-age person has a full-time job plus any desired overtime, or that the Phillips curve – which posits an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment – is dead when it is, at most, stunned.
Now, it seems, the Fed will not tighten monetary policy even when the actual level of employment exceeds that at which inflationary pressures in the labor market manifest themselves – which is bound to be well below the FOMC’s maximum employment level.
The Fed’s mandated targets should have clear normative content and be susceptible to policy.
But, regarding price stability, the FOMC has switched to a flexible form of average inflation targeting – itself a non-transparent form of price-level targeting.
According to the press release, the Fed now “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time.”
Therefore, “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time.”
This means that past inflation will influence the Fed’s current and future monetary policy.
But past inflation is a bygone issue and should be irrelevant for formulating policy – unlike current and expected inflation, which have normative content and can be influenced by policy.
Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more – All for less than $9 a month.
Of course, when inflation expectations are influenced by past inflation, then the past will influence current and future monetary policy.
But there are, and always will be, other drivers of inflation expectations.
Average inflation targeting is just bad economics.
Instead, flexible inflation targeting is by far the best way to formulate the objectives and modus operandi of monetary policy.
Under such a regime, a central bank raises (lowers) policy rates when anticipated future inflation is above (below) target and when employment is above (below) the best estimate of maximum employment.
This is defined as the equilibrium level of employment when both actual and expected inflation are equal to the target rate of inflation – in other words, the natural level of employment.
Then there are the Fed’s major errors of omission. For starters, the FOMC does not mention enhancing its monetary-policy arsenal by removing the effective lower bound (ELB) on policy rates.
Today’s persistent low-interest-rate environment supposedly implies that policy rates are more likely to be constrained by their ELB than in the past.
But this is because policymakers in the US and around the world have been unwilling to remove it.
Abolishing cash would be the easiest way to eliminate the ELB (and would have the further benefit of taxing criminal activity), but there are other ways to achieve the same goal.
Such a step would enable the Fed not only to cut policy rates when it otherwise would have been thwarted by the ELB, but also to lower the inflation target to the level consistent with a zero “true” inflation rate – likely below 2%.
The FOMC’s second major error of omission is the absence of any discussion of the Fed’s failure, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, to enlarge and change the composition of its balance sheet to the fullest possible extent to support economic activity.
As of the week of January 6, 2020, the Fed had consolidated assets of $4.15 trillion, or 19.3% of US GDP in 2019.
By the week of August 17, its balance sheet had grown to $7.01 trillion, or 32.7% of 2019 GDP.
But this growth – equivalent to 13.4% of last year’s GDP in just seven months – seems less impressive when compared to the evolution of the European Central Bank’s balance sheet over the same period.
Between January 3 and August 14, the consolidated Eurosystem’s total assets increased from nearly €4.7 trillion ($5.6 trillion), or 39.2% of the eurozone’s 2019 GDP, to €6.4 trillion, or 53.7% of 2019 GDP.
The Eurosystem’s balance sheet thus grew faster than the Fed’s – by the equivalent of 14.5% of last year’s GDP – during the same period.
The Fed should convince the US Treasury Department to provide more equity and to guarantee more of the Fed’s risky assets on what should be a significantly larger balance sheet.
As the issuer of the only viable global reserve currency, the Fed has an unequaled ability to enlarge its balance sheet and increase its risk, even without additional Treasury support.
But it simply has not done enough during the pandemic.
The recent changes to the US monetary policy framework are ill-advised and potentially harmful.
They also fail to address a number of other crucial problems.
The Fed should scrap this new approach, and instead make full and effective use of the policy instruments it has – or could have – at its disposal.
.
Mr President, let us be clear, this is a most regrettable business.
It would be most unfortunate if the Pakistani authorities were to believe that they could resolve the case by detaining the crew.
As the honourable Member said earlier, next week the EU Troika will be visiting Islamabad and I will once again appeal to the Pakistani authorities to release the crew on humanitarian grounds, in line with a guarantee that I understand has been given by the Greek Government to ensure that the crew would cooperate in any investigation that subsequently takes place.
That seems to be a sensible way to proceed and I do not know what further the Pakistani authorities can expect from the Greek Government.
The Commission would recommend arbitration according to internationally established standards along the lines of the 1992 Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage.
We encourage Pakistan to discuss the advantages of ratifying the convention with officials of the International Maritime Organisation.
In the meantime, it would be constructive to settle compensation claims in line with the convention's regulations, as though Pakistan was already party to the convention.
That is what the insurers have proposed.
I have already raised the issue with the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Mr Kasuri, during his visit to Brussels on 5 November 2003.
Heads of our European Union Missions in Islamabad have discussed the issue on several occasions with the Pakistani authorities, including Mr Kasuri.
As referred to earlier, I and the Foreign Ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands have agreed that during our visit Pakistan on 18 February we would raise the issue again if the situation remained unchanged.
It would obviously be admirable if things could be sorted out even before next week.
I repeat, this deplorable situation has gone on for far too long.
The sooner it is resolved the better, and our sympathy goes out to the families of the crewmen and to the crewmen themselves, who have been detained in these circumstances for so long.
Madam President, the oral amendment is on amendment 1 to paragraph 3.
It proposes the replacement of 'road map' with 'action plan' as this is the correct formulation.
So this amendment will now read 'Calls on the Council to invite the Commission to quickly develop the action plan' and so on.
Brussels, 4 December 2002
Commission opts for long-term recovery plan for cod rather than moratorium, Fischler tells European Parliament
A ban on haddock and whiting fishing is also recommended because cod is a by-catch in those fisheries.
It has not proved enough just to reduce cod fishing over the last few years.
Scientists have therefore repeatedly warned that we must also reduce fishing effort so that we can better monitor compliance with total allowable catches and thus avoid giving an over-optimistic picture of the state of our stocks.
I quote from the 1990 ICES report on cod and other stocks: "... fishing mortality rates can only be reduced on these stocks by direct control of fishing effort.
"We forwarded the ICES findings to our Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), which advised that the probability of cod stock recovery will remain low unless stringent management action is taken immediately."
"The Commission already proposed a reduction in fishing effort a year ago in its recovery plan for cod and hake.
No Council decision has been forthcoming and in the meantime the situation has continued to worsen.
In view of this situation, the Commission has weighed the various options.
We have decided against a moratorium in favour of an improved long-term recovery plan for cod and hake in line with the latest scientific findings.
On what points does the new plan differ from last year's plan?
Translated into fishing opportunities, the drastically reduced fishing effort would mean a total allowable catch in the North Sea of 16,800 tonnes of cod (-66% compared to 2002), 31,600 tonnes of haddock (-70%), 10,000 tonnes of whiting (-76%), 60,000 tonnes of plaice and 13,500 tonnes of sole (-17%).
For West of Scotland the figures are 972 tonnes of cod (-79%), 7,200 tonnes of haddock (-49%) and for the Irish Sea 1,200 tonnes of cod (-63%), 7,500 tonnes of haddock (-20%) and 400 tonnes of whiting (-60%).
Of course, these are just a few of the overall catch quantities.
We propose a simplified system for fishing effort limitation in which we would manage the effort not by individual vessel, but by groups of vessels.
We would tighten our proposal on controls.
I would also be prepared to fund further research to help us find suitable measures to save this fishery.
But that must not involve any further postponement of the measures required.
Our goal is for a decision on the improved recovery plan to be adopted together with the fishery reform in December.
What does the plan mean for the industry as a whole and fishermen in particular?
I am fully aware that the plan will have serious consequences for the fishing sector in the short term and I know that the livelihood of many may be at stake.
In these hard times we cannot leave fishermen and their families standing alone.
Therefore, at the beginning of November the Commission put forward an action plan to cushion the negative socio-economic impact of the reform.
I would like to mention just three of the concrete measures we set out in this plan:
Firstly, the Member States should consider re-targeting their other structural programmes as well and providing additional resources for the fishery sector and areas dependent on fishing.
Secondly, the Member States could introduce specific measures for more labour-intensive small-scale coastal fishing.
For example, some fishing grounds could be reserved for small vessels, or Member States could target their programmes at small-scale fleets to save jobs, particularly in coastal areas.
Thirdly, it is essential to diversify the economic opportunities in coastal areas.
The Member States can already grant compensatory payments to fishermen and ship owners for the temporary suspension of their activities.
I again appeal to the Member States to adjust their programmes and provide more resources for social measures.
I have also given an undertaking to find additional resources where needed under the mid-term review of the Structural Funds at the end of 2003.
In conclusion I would like to give you one thing to ponder.
But as much as 200 000 tonnes could be fished every year if we managed the stock sensibly.
This shows how badly we have looked after our resources."
Brussels, 12 March 2007
"The priorities adopted by the FAO Committee for the next two years are very much in line with our own international agenda.
This is particularly the case with regard to the importance we attach to combating Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing and on protecting the marine environment on the high seas.
Commissioner Borg said that COFI had empowered the FAO to take real concrete action in these two crucial areas.
It was now for FAO Members to act.
"FAO can count on our full cooperation and support in this area.
I am also pleased that we now have a timetable for action to limit the destructive impact of deep sea fisheries.
For its part, the Commission will come up with proposals for effective measures in this domain in the coming months", Commissioner Borg concluded.
Brussels, 3 March 2009
EU campaign on the gender pay gap
Why is the European Commission launching a campaign on the pay gap?
The pay gap is linked to a number of complex causes which are frequently interrelated: the undervaluing of women’s work, segregation in the labour market, traditions and stereotypes, and problems in balancing work and private life.
The gender pay gap is the consequence of all these factors and inequalities in the labour market.
The campaign aims to raise public awareness of the gender pay gap and to explain how it can be tackled.
What kinds of tools are included in this campaign?
The campaign includes posters, a campaign toolbox to be distributed among employers and trade unions across the EU, a VNR (video news release) and a video clip showcasing how the pay gap affects women throughout the lifecycle.
Other activities include advertising in European press.
It will run until August 2009.
Equal pay for equal work is one of the European Union’s founding principles.
Enshrined in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, it was the subject of a 1975 directive which prohibits all discrimination in all aspects of pay between women and men for the same work or for work of equal value.
Moreover, closing the gender pay gap can also benefit companies.
Employers that build equality into their workplaces will create the best places to work for everyone.
Paying women and men for their actual skills and valuing their contribution on an equal basis results in recruitment and retention of the best and most talented staff.
Closing the gender pay gap also benefits the economy as a whole.
The under-utilisation of women’s skills is a lost resource for the economy and for society at large.
A better use of women’s skills allows Europe to better face up to global competition.
Finally, closing the gender pay gap contributes to creating a more equal society and to financial and economic independence for women.
How big is the pay gap in different Member States?
Measured as the "relative difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men", the gender pay gap is estimated to be 17.4% in the EU as a whole (see graph below).
[ Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED ]
From the last Eurostat data (2007), it appears that there are still considerable differences between the Member States, with the pay gap ranging from less than 10% in Italy, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Belgium to more than 20% in Slovakia, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, United Kingdom and Greece and more than 25% in Estonia and Austria.
Recently, Eurostat changed its method of calculating the gender pay gap in order to improve comparability between Member States: instead of a mix of various national sources, it now uses an EU harmonised source (Structure of Earnings Survey), with the support of comparable national sources for the yearly estimates.
The apparent increase of the gender pay gap, from 15% in 2006 to 17.4% today should be attributed to methodological changes and is not a real increase.
The pay gap is not an indicator of the overall equality between women and men since it measures only the earnings differences between men and women that are in paid employment.
In most of the countries in which the female employment rate is low (e.g.
How did the gender pay gap evolve over the last few years?
Due to the change in the statistical methodology, for most Member States it is only possible to compare 2007 with 2006 data.
However, if we restrict the pay gap to the private sector, comparisons can be made with regard to 2002.
The average gender pay gap in the private sector for EU-27 has evolved from 23% in 2002 to 22.2% in 2006 and 21.6% in 2007.
There is therefore a small decrease in the pay gap.
This change conceals differences among Member States.
For instance, the gender pay gap is estimated to have fallen in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovakia and the UK while it has risen in the Netherlands, Estonia and Lithuania.
In July 2007 the Commission issued a policy report "Tackling the pay gap between women and men" which analysed the different causes of the gender pay gap and identified four fields of action at European level to fight it: legislation, the European strategy for growth and jobs, employers' responsibility and exchange of good practices.
It highlighted that the pay gap can only be tackled by acting at all levels, involving all stakeholders and focusing on all the factors that cause it.
At legislative level, the European Commission is currently analysing the effectiveness of European law on equal pay.
Depending on the results of the analysis, the Commission may present new legislative proposals on this issue.
In addition, tackling the gender pay gap is part of the broader European strategy for growth and jobs and the European Commission is monitoring progress made in that field through statistics and analysis of employment policies.

Mr President, as a member of Solidarność, and someone who has experienced martial law in Poland, I know that freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy.
The Kenyan Government signed and ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.
These conventions include the right to freedom of speech.
Today, the Eastern Africa Journalists Association informs us that the government intends to introduce censorship in Kenya.
I hope that President Kibaki will refrain from any amendments to legislation concerning the media, which could infringe the freedom of speech.
I call on the Kenyan authorities to relinquish their plans to introduce censorship, to build consensus in order to foster the freedom of the press and the public communications sector.
I hope that the rights of religious and ethnic minorities will be respected in Kenya.
A year ago, over a thousand people died during protests linked to the elections and 350 000 people fled their homes.
I hope that those responsible for these incidents will be justly punished.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago we passed a resolution supporting the position taken by the Dalai Lama in negotiations with China, that is to say non-violence and autonomy - not independence - for Tibet.
China broke up these talks, accusing the Dalai Lama of being violent, causing violence and seeking independence rather than autonomy.
So, today, on the 50th anniversary of the Lhasa uprising, it would be completely incomprehensible if this Parliament did not intervene, not only to defend the Dalai Lama and non-violence, but also to defend the position and reputation of Parliament.
We are not asking for other items to be taken off the agenda; we are simply asking Parliament to have the courage to express an opinion.
For this reason we are requesting that a resolution be put to the vote in addition to the debate.

Investing on time to deliver jobs and inclusion: CoR plenary to focus on EU structural funds and youth employment
CoR President Valcárcel and Commissioner Hahn to lead debate on future implementation of EU cohesion policy
The one day event will be an opportunity to consider what can be done to ensure that programmes funded by EU cohesion policy start swiftly and on time.
The outcome of a CoR survey will also be presented assessing the progress made in each Member State in shaping operational programmes.
As cultural markets are crucially dependent from public expenditure, CoR argues that, as far as possible, public policies should not let them be seen as easy targets for financial cuts.
The issue will be debated through the presentation of a drafted opinion by Anton Rombouts (NL/EPP) , Mayor of 's-Hertogenbosch, on the European Commission's strategy to boost growth and jobs in cultural and creative sectors.
Phasing-out of EU milk quotas
The EU milk quota system, which came into force in 1984, looked to address the problem of over-production.
However following changes in the market, quotas are now expected to be abolished in 2015.
Mr. Souchon argues that not enough consideration has been given to the territorial and regional impact of the proposals.
It questions the Commission's argument for the total abolition of milk quotas and market liberalisation of the milk market and calls for further analysis on its consequences for Europe's regions.
Local policy approaches and good practices will be discussed, together with lessons learnt from successful transnational cooperation.
The full session will be web streamed live on: www.cor.europa.eu .

10 EUROPE'S WAY TO THE INFORMATION SOCIETY - ACTION PLAN II . . . . . . . .
The debate focused essentially on the outstanding central issue of the next stage of liberalisation.
WTO/GATS NEGOTIATIONS - BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS The Commission reported on the latest developments with regard to the WTO/GATS negotiations on basic telecommunications.
The Commission would therefore present a Communication to the Council in 1997 outlining an action plan for further research in this area.
COMMISSION GREEN PAPER ON NUMBERING Mr Bangemann briefed the Council on the Commission's new Green Paper on a numbering policy for telecommunications services in Europe which it sees as an important step for the completion of the internal market.
The Commission has launched a three-month public consultation on this Green paper after it will present the appropriate legislative proposals.
Where legislative acts are involved, votes against or abstentions are indicated.
For this purpose, it provides a framework for participation by EFTA Member States in the programme encouraging the development and distribution of European audiovisual works (MEDIA II - Development and distribution) and the training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programme industry (MEDIA II - Training) for the period from 1996 to 2000.
Masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers The Council adopted the Common position on the Proposal for a Directive relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers.
(LV) Mr President, I fully support the insistence of the European Parliament and of the Members present that human rights not only in the European Union, but also throughout the whole of the world, are fundamental rights, namely, the foundations of life.
However, I do not support broadly charging a country (without citing any specific examples), its leader or all of its people with crimes that they have not committed.
If we are talking about the fact that someone in the opposition (and not only from the opposition, but others too) is arrested after certain events, and see in that circumstance some sort of dictatorship, then what is the purpose of courts in a democratic system?
Let the courts deal with whatever happened there, and with who has been rightly and wrongly sentenced or arrested.
The fact that you belong to the opposition is not yet grounds for allowing you to do whatever comes into your head.
I ask for an extremely tolerant and balanced attitude towards everyone.

(PL) I am delighted at the near unanimous adoption of Mrs Lulling's report by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
The report concerns the introduction of amendments to the directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men engaged in activity in a self-employed capacity.
It is very important that a compromise has been reached and an improvement made to the situation of self-employed people, who make up about 10% of all people in the labour market.
Among the amendments introduced, the most important is the possibility for self-employed people and their spouses or life partners to receive social benefits, including, most importantly, the possibility to pay contributions towards their own retirement pension, and also to have paid maternity leave analogous to that which is given to women who work for an employer.
These entitlements are to be provided for by legislation at EU level.
They are measures which will not only help to improve the situation of women, but will also reduce the significant inequalities that exist between the self-employed and people who work for an employer.
Millions of people who work in family businesses will at last gain the ability to benefit from voluntary social protection based on affiliation to a system of social insurance, without which they have been in a worse situation.
This is an important step forward, all the more so because the compromise reached this year had, for many years, been impossible to achieve.
I encourage all fellow Members to endorse this report.
I would like, at this point, to thank Mrs Lulling very sincerely, because thanks to this report, many self-employed women will find life easier.
in writing. - This resolution sends a clear signal to the other institutions that the European Parliament is willing to start serious negotiations in order to resolve the current budget deadlock and to decide upon a budget for 2011 as soon as possible.
Reaching a deal will mean that single farm payments are not delayed, and funding for Structural Funds is not affected.
I believe that MEPs, as the only directly elected representatives in the EU, should be involved in shaping the next financial perspective in order to achieve the best deal for UK citizens.
Steps need to be taken to make the EU budget more flexible.
This will enable the EU to react quickly to crises and will allow unforeseen needs to be financed.
The resolution also calls for a much-needed discussion on new ways to finance the EU, which could reduce the cost of the EU for British taxpayers.

Deauville partnership and Tunisia: new EUR 140 million commitment in support of economic and social development
The prod uction of sulphuric acid (capacity of 600 kt/year) and phosphoric acid (capacity of 200 kt/year) to increase the output of the existing triple superphosphate ( TSP) fertiliser plant but also to make flexibility gains and be able to switch between TSP and phosphoric acid, meeting market demand better ;
Creation of a substantial number of jobs (estimated at around 1 400 during the construction phase then 400 permanent direct jobs on site, plus the indirect jobs generated, in a disadvantaged region with high unemployment;
Environmentally friendly industrial development: the new plant will be built closer to the phosphate mines and to the highest environmental standards.
Of particular importance for economic development and social cohesion in Tunisia, this signature was described by EIB Vice-President Philippe de Fontaine Vive in these terms: “
Job creation is our top priority, especially in disadvantaged regions like Gafsa, in order to provide young people with hope for the future.
This is why we are supporting projects with strong industrial potential that act as genuine levers of economic growth and social integration in Tunisia.”
It is only fourth months since the Deauville G8 summit and two loans totalling EUR 300 million (nearly TND 600 million) in support of employment and economic development in Tunisia have been signed already.
The EIB has decided to dedicate EUR 6 billion to the Mediterranean region by 2013, including EUR 3.5 billion for Egypt and Tunisia.

(FR) Mr President, the purpose of this debate is not to set ourselves up as prosecutors and judge what we are not qualified to judge.
Our aim, a twin aim as it happens, is, first of all, to help shed light on the responsibility of the different parties in the Gaza war and, beyond that, looking more to the future, I would say, we must ask ourselves what we can say and do today to help rebuild a dialogue.
As it happens, I do not think that the Goldstone report is constructive in this regard.
Furthermore - and it is worth recalling because it is rare - this was the conclusion reached by all the European countries, none of which have supported it in front of the worthy prosecutors and great defenders of freedoms and of human rights that are China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Cuba, to cite just a few examples.
The report is much debated, it is biased and, whether we like it or not, it will not help us move forward.
On the other hand, it is up to Israel to choose to assume its responsibilities as a democratic state and to shed full light on the war in Gaza.
At stake are its military, diplomatic and media interests - those interests that the Hebrew state was able to establish in the past.
Brussels, 14 June 2007
Louis Michel expresses concern over "growing humanitarian tragedy in Gaza"
Louis Michel, the European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, has expressed his deep concern over the escalating violence between the Fatah and Hamas factions in the Gaza Strip.
This is the first time this has ever happened in the long history of EC humanitarian support to the Palestinian population in Gaza.
He continued: "
I fervently hope that the projects can resume very soon.
This is a time when people desperately need protection and support.
China’s Not-So-New Not-So-Normal
HONG KONG – I just spent a week in China, where I participated in the Boao Asia Forum, a conference similar to the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The topic of my panel was what President Xi Jinping has called the Chinese economy’s “new normal”: an era of relatively slower growth, following three decades of double-digit economic expansion.
But what strikes me most about China’s economy is how remarkable it is.
Indeed, its performance continues to astound me.
Though it undoubtedly faces plenty of challenges, the key question is how likely they are to bring down the economy.
Of the four BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – Xi’s is the only one that has met my expectations for growth so far this decade.
From 2011 to 2014, the Chinese economy grew at an average annual rate of 8% per year.
If it continues to grow by around 7% for the rest of the decade, as the authorities and many observers expect, it will achieve an average pace of expansion of 7.5%, in line with my projections.
The phrase “new normal” is a clever bit of messaging by China’s leaders, who must explain to the country’s 1.4 billion citizens why the economy will no longer be growing by 10% a year.
But there is nothing normal about an economy that is already twice as large as the next largest, Japan, and will possibly outstrip the European Union within the next five years.
I was in China primarily in my role as Chair of the British government’s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance; but I also sought opportunities to speak to people about the challenges facing the economy.
Many international observers have been worried about the country’s oversupply of housing and the related credit boom, making me wonder whether I have been overly sanguine about these risks.
But my conversations persuaded me that both problems are likely to be manageable.
To be sure, the housing market is in the doldrums.
But, as many pointed out to me, this is partly the result of deliberate government measures to deflate it (also comforting is the fact that consumers are in general not overleveraged).
Some builders will experience problems with credit, and so might some local authorities.
But spending by the central government is such a small percentage of the country’s total GDP that policymakers have a lot of room for maneuver if intervention becomes necessary in these areas.
Foreign observers frequently speculate that the Chinese authorities may be deliberately overstating the economy’s strength.
But it is equally possible that the size of some sectors is being understated.
After spending a few days in Beijing, it was abundantly clear that China is undergoing a boom in Internet use, including as a consumer platform.
Online commerce is offsetting some of the other weaker areas of the economy, and its full impact might actually be underreported in official statistics.
I do worry that the government is not moving fast enough to grant the country’s millions of migrant workers official residency in the cities where they work and live.
Migrants’ continued lack of access to public services might prevent a large rise in consumption as a share of GDP.
But, as I was told during my visit, the central government’s reluctance to move more quickly reflects its wariness of imposing immense fiscal pressures on local authorities.
Another area of serious concern is health care.
At some stage, the central government will have to address the sector’s deficiencies.
I learned about one example when discussing antimicrobial resistance, to which the government has responded by attempting to limit the quantity of antibiotics a patient may take.
The trouble is that many hospitals and doctors rely on drug sales for a large portion of their revenues, which creates a powerful incentive to find ways to circumvent the rules.
Pollution remains a grave challenge as well.
But it must also be noted that China’s carbon dioxide emissions declined notably in 2014, offering what is perhaps the first tangible evidence that the country is making some progress on this front.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy use are both on the rise as well.
Most important, despite the challenges it faces, the Chinese economy’s singular importance is now widely recognized.
The country’s recent international achievements – particular its ability to secure the backing of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy for its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in the face of opposition from the United States – imply a high degree of confidence that China will address its problems successfully.
China’s role within existing international financial institutions could change this year as well.
In December, the International Monetary Fund will consider adding renminbi to the basket of currencies that comprise the Fund’s unit of account, known as Special Drawing Rights, alongside the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.
And the world is still waiting for the US to implement a 2010 reform of the IMF that would strengthen the position of China and other large emerging economies in the institution’s governance structure.
Given the significance of the Chinese economy, continuing to leave this unaddressed is anything but normal.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
More than 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, 30 million of them in Europe and 200 000 of them in Hungary.
Eighteen per cent of asthmatics in Western Europe are classified in the severe group.
The number of asthma patients in my home country of Hungary has increased by 250% over the last ten years.
The number of new patients diagnosed each year has doubled over the same period.
First among the causes that trigger asthma and asthma attacks is air pollution.
I think that the data in the report before us speaks for itself and its fate, which we will decide tomorrow, is only partly about environmental protection and much more about quality of life and health protection.
One of the greatest problems in Union legislation today is its lack of implementation.
Unfortunately this is also true of legislation on air quality.
Therefore, our primary task now is not to vote for more rules that are even more stringent but to promote compliance with the existing rules.
The place where I live, Budapest, is a city of two million people, and with regard to air particles, for example, it exceeds the permitted limits even in the first four months of the year, and indeed excesses of 4-5 times are not uncommon.
Our task is therefore to develop the current legislation further in a sensible way and to prepare guidelines that do not stipulate additional tasks but refine the existing ones to really contribute to cleaner air for the population of the EU.
I think the Krahmer report fulfils this requirement.
Its virtue is that it wants to measure and capture air pollution primarily at the place of pollution, which is technically the right approach.
The compromise is therefore not ambitious but progressive.
I trust that the cities and Member States concerned will now be able to implement it more consistently and that we will perhaps be able to pass on a more habitable Europe to our children.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
.I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Berend, on the proposal for a regulation, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund.
It was becoming urgent to reform the Fund, which was created in 2002 and which has sole responsibility for dealing exclusively with natural disasters, in order to enlarge its scope, to simplify the way in which it is used from the point of view of emergencies and, lastly, to prevent misuse.
Not only the major climate, industrial and technological changes, but also terrorism, health risks and so on were making it crucial for the European Union to provide its citizens and the Member States with access to a tool that is capable of coping with a disaster that would render a Member State, on its own, powerless.
The reform of this Fund is a crucial safety element in today’s risk society.
10. China's policy and its effects on Africa (
- Before the vote on Amendment 5:
Mr Maňka's report proposes several amendments to the European Parliament's 2010 budget.
I voted for this report and, in particular, for its provisions that follow on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009.
These include the EUR 1 500 per month increase in Members' assistance expenses.
This increase is designed to enable Members to meet their new responsibilities arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, which considerably extends the scope of Parliament, thereby increasing its influence on EU decision making.
Parliament needs to increase its expertise in legislative issues in order to match the Commission and the Member States.
We represent European citizens and we need appropriate resources if we wish to defend their interests.
I therefore supported this report.
In November retail trade remained stable in the euro area and rose by 0.3% in the EU28.

STAT/16/219
Mr President, today is an important milestone because, after many years of debate and findings on the need to reinforce the Union's ability to take prompt, coordinated action on public health threats, we are finally discussing the setting up of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Over the last twenty years, there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases, or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses, or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, to give but one example.
All these crises in the public health sector, such as SARS and bird flu recently, have highlighted the weaknesses and gaps in existing structures.
I hope that the Centre, with its small but adequate scientific operating structure, will be able to plug these gaps efficiently.
However, if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient, it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the Member States.
I should like to thank the rapporteur because not only did he accept the amendments which I proposed but, subsequently, in conjunction with them, two very important issues were approved and accepted which had not been included in the initial proposal.
The first concerns the development of the strategy of vaccinations, which are an extremely important weapon in combating the threat from infections diseases.
The second relates to the identification of topical public health issues and the promotion of the relevant, applied research, in order to reinforce our preventive capabilities and promote the efficiency of the coordinated action taken.
Mr President, I hope that we will also overcome these final hesitations and that the Centre will soon be up and running, even in its present, restricted form.
Mr President, this vote is also a litmus test of whether the EU is a community of values or whether human dignity and human rights are under threat.
Regarding embryos as exploitable material risks opening the ethical floodgates.
We have some very successful alternatives such as adult stem cells and research on umbilical-cord blood cells.
It is incomprehensible why the EU is unnecessarily risking dividing the EU on this.
The cloning scandal in South Korea has made it clear that a principle, too, is at stake, namely the ban on commercialising the human body – the female body in particular.
Women are degraded to the level of suppliers of egg cells as raw materials.
The proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy even entails the risk of setting in motion human cloning, because the revision clause envisages exactly that.
I would plead, therefore, that we not be responsible for opening the door to the acceptance of embryonic stem cell research in Member States in which this is prohibited – that would be questionable from the point of view of democratic politics – and certainly not be responsible for paving the way for human cloning.
Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate.
I would particularly like to touch on what was said by Mrs Andreasen and Mr Ehrenhauser, and point out that when we began this process there was no agreement whatsoever.
When we began this process, we got no response when we put questions to the Commission and requested written answers.
When we began this process, the Commission left meetings whenever we started asking questions.
That was the position we started from.
Our task today is to decide whether we have moved a step closer or whether we are still in the same situation.
The question is not whether we have achieved everything we wanted to.
I agree that we have not achieved everything we wanted to.
You only have to read my report, and now the committee's report, to see that we are still unhappy.
I would also ask the Council to read the report very thoroughly, because it contains many good points that could be useful for next year.
We have come a step closer, however.
When we start on the 2008 discharge - and we are doing that even now - we will not be starting from a blank sheet.
We will be starting from the point we have reached this year.
I therefore believe it is right to defend what we have achieved by voting in favour, thereby continuing this struggle - which is, after all, what it is.
Time will tell - when we see how things go this year and next year and the year after that - whether we made the right decision.
That is why it is crucial that we as a committee, and as Parliament, are capable of standing together and sticking to what we set out to do all along.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the secretariat, the shadow rapporteurs and the entire committee, including its chairman, for enabling us to show a united front.
If we can maintain this solidarity - including when it comes to the 2008 discharge - then in 2008, we will be able to move a step further, beyond what we achieved in 2007.
Then we will be in a position to achieve what we all want to achieve.
Commission welcomes approval of Creative Europe programme by European Parliament
Creative Europe will provide funding for at least 250 000 artists and cultural professionals, 2 000 cinemas, 800 films and 4 500 book translations.
This investment is great news for Europe's film industry, for culture and the arts, and for the public.
Creative Europe will enable our dynamic cultural sectors to create new jobs and contribute more to the EU economy.
It will enable thousands of talented artists to reach new audiences in Europe and beyond, while also promoting cultural and linguistic diversity.
Creative Europe builds on the experience and success of the Culture and MEDIA programmes, which have supported the cultural and audiovisual sectors for more than 20 years.
A new cross-sectoral strand will support policy cooperation, transversal measures and the new financial guarantee facility, which will be operational from 2016.
The European Capitals of Culture , European Heritage Label , European Heritage Days and the five European prizes (EU Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Awards, EU Prize for Contemporary Architecture, EU Prize for Literature, European Border Breakers Awards, and EU Prix MEDIA) will also receive support from Creative Europe.
The programme will allocate at least 56% of its budget for the MEDIA sub-programme and at least 31% for the Culture sub-programme.
This broadly reflects the share of funding that the two areas currently receive.
Creative Europe: who benefits?
Creative Europe will support:
250 000 artists and cultural professionals and their work, allowing them to reach new audiences beyond their home countries;
More than 800 European films will receive distribution support so that they can be seen by audiences throughout Europe and the world;
At least 2 000 European cinemas will benefit from funding, provided that at least 50% of the films they screen are European;
More than 4 500 books and other literary works will receive translation support, allowing authors to break into new markets and readers to enjoy them in their mother tongue;
Thousands of cultural and audiovisual organisations and professionals will benefit from funding for training to gain new skills and to strengthen their capacity to work internationally.
The European cultural and creative sectors represent up to 4.5% of EU GDP and employ more than 8 million people.
Creative Europe will help them to contribute even more to the European economy by seizing the opportunities created by globalisation and the digital shift.
It will also enable them to overcome challenges such as market fragmentation and difficulties in accessing financing, as well as contributing to better policy-making by making it easier to share know-how and experience.
Next steps
The Creative Europe programme will be definitively adopted by the Council (28 Member States) in the weeks to come and will enter into force in January 2014.

The earthquake which devastated Haiti on 12 January, leaving 200 000 dead and approximately 250 000 injured, has prompted the European Union Member States and the entire international community to engage in a tangible and shared commitment to reconstruct the country.
Such coordination has shown itself to be effective in the short term, and has seen an initial pledging of considerable sums by the European Commission and by individual Member States.
I believe it is essential to direct this joint effort so that the reconstruction is sustainable in the medium and long term, and so that the population of Haiti is the main beneficiary of this commitment.
I add my voice to the appeal by international humanitarian organisations to prevent the enormous number of children orphaned as a result of the earthquake becoming victims of human traffickers.
I therefore believe that we need a plan to supervise such an emergency, ensuring that the primary needs of the weakest groups in the community take first place amongst the priorities of Europe and the United States.
The Commission is also monitoring the implementation of the Directive by the other member states.

State aid: Commission authorises guarantees for Irish financial institutions
The scheme features higher premiums to be paid by the banks for the guarantees granted by the State and foresees adequate safeguards to minimise potential distortions of competition.
A similar scheme (see IP/10/854 ) will expire at the end of this month.
The Commission considers that the guarantee measure is well targeted, proportionate and limited in time and scope.
The guarantees are necessary to ensure continued access to funding for Irish banks in the coming months thereby contributing to financial stability in Ireland.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number N 347/2010 in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.
New publications of state aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the State Aid Weekly e-News .
It held that they do not involve State aid under Article 92(1) of the EEC Treaty.
DB furthermore may offer certain additional financial incentives, such as defrayal of the necessary costs of alterations to facilities.
in writing. - Willi Piecyk's report 'An integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union' addresses the challenges that Europe's maritime industry now faces.
Its recommendations will help facilitate Europe-wide decision-making in the area.
It is only in establishing an integrated maritime policy that global issues such as globalisation and climate change and their effects on our oceans can be effectively engaged with.
I voted in support of the report.
I still firmly believe that, as President Sarkozy was not going to organise a referendum, abstention was the position the Socialists had to take in the French parliament.
However, just because the French President did a poor job of negotiating this Treaty and ignored the vote of the French people, that does not mean we should not respond to the question being put before us today.
The Treaty is far from perfect, but it enables us to bring the institutional debate to a close and equip Europe with rules that allow it to function.
Today, the Socialists should make themselves heard on policy changes, the main issue in the revision of the financial perspective, on the French Presidency of the European Union, and on the PSE's commitment in drawing up its manifesto for the next European elections.
A 'no' would have made it possible to remove the policies from the text of what should have been a Constitution, as it forced Europe to focus on the issue of what the European project was all about.
This is very important.
However, because I want this text to be passed so I can get fully involved in the forthcoming negotiations on policies, because my 'no' more than two years ago was pro-European, I am shouldering my responsibilities and approving the Treaty of Lisbon.
Power and Interdependence in the Trump Era
CAMBRIDGE – US President Donald Trump has been accused of weaponizing economic globalization.
Sanctions, tariffs, and the restriction of access to dollars have been major instruments of his foreign policy, and he has been unconstrained by allies, institutions, or rules in using them. According to The Economist, America derives its clout not just from troops and aircraft carriers, but from being the central node in the network that underpins globalization.
“This mesh of firms, ideas and standards reflects and magnifies American prowess.” But Trump’s approach may “spark a crisis, and it is eroding America’s most valuable asset – its legitimacy.”
Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
Trump is not the first president to manipulate economic interdependence, nor is the United States the only country to do so.
For example, in 1973, Arab states used an oil embargo to punish the US for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War.
Shortly thereafter, Robert O. Keohane and I published Power and Interdependence, a book that explored the variety of ways in which asymmetrical interdependence can be manipulated as a source of power.
But we also warned that short-term gains sometimes turn into long-term losses.
For example, during that period, President Richard M. Nixon restricted US soybean exports in hopes of dampening inflation.
But in the longer term, soybean markets in Brazil expanded rapidly – and competed with American producers.
In 2010, after a collision of Chinese and Japanese ships near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, China punished Japan by restricting exports of rare-earth metals, which are essential in modern electronics.
The result was that Japan lent money to an Australian mining company with a refinery in Malaysia, which today meets nearly one-third of Japanese demand.
In addition, the Mountain Pass mine in California, which had shut in the early 2000s, was reopened.
China’s share of global rare-earth production has fallen from more than 95% in 2010 to 70% last year.
This year, in a not-too-subtle response to Trump’s tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping made sure he was photographed visiting a rare-earth production site whose exports are vital to US electronics producers.
The US (and other countries) have legitimate complaints about Chinese economic behavior such as the theft of intellectual property and subsidies to state-owned companies that have tilted the playing field in trade.
Moreover, there are important security reasons for the US to avoid becoming dependent on Chinese companies like Huawei for 5G wireless.
And China has refused to allow Facebook or Google to operate within its Great Firewall for security reasons related to freedom of speech.
But it is one thing to restrict certain technologies and companies for security reasons and quite another to cause massive disruption of commercial supply chains to develop political influence.
It is not clear how long the influence will last or what the long-term costs will turn out to be.
Even if other countries are unable to extricate themselves from US networks of interdependence in the short term, incentives to do so will strengthen in the longer run.
In the meantime, there will be costly damage to the international institutions that limit conflict and create global public goods.
As Henry Kissinger has pointed out, world order depends not only on a stable balance of power, but also on a sense of legitimacy, to which institutions contribute.
Trump was right to respond to Chinese economic behavior, but he was wrong to do it without regard for the costs imposed on US allies and international institutions.
The same problem weakens his policies toward Iran and Europe.
Alliances like NATO stabilize expectations, and the existence of institutions like the United Nations, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the International Atomic Energy Agency enhances security.
Open markets and economic globalization can be disruptive, but they also create wealth (albeit often unequally distributed).
Maintaining financial stability is crucial to the daily lives of millions of Americans and foreigners alike, even though they may not notice it until it is absent.
And regardless of what a nativist populist backlash does to economic globalization, ecological globalization is unavoidable.
Greenhouse gases and pandemics do not respect political borders.
The laws of populist politics, which have dictated Trump’s denial of the science and his withdrawal of the US from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, are incompatible with the laws of physics.
States will increasingly need a framework to enhance cooperation on the use of the sea and space, and on combating climate change and pandemics.
Referring to such a framework as a “liberal international order” confuses choices by conflating promotion of liberal democratic values with the creation of an institutional framework for promoting global public goods.
China and the US disagree about liberal democracy, but we share an interest in developing an open, rules-based system to manage economic and ecological interdependence.
Some defenders of the Trump administration argue that his unorthodox style and willingness to break rules and spurn institutions will produce major gains on issues like North Korea’s nuclear weapons, China’s coerced technology transfer, or regime change in Iran.
But the relationship of power and interdependence changes over time, and too much manipulation of America’s privileged position in global interdependence could prove self-defeating.
As The Economist argued, the institutional costs of using a wrecking-ball approach may reduce American power in the long run.
In that case, Trump’s approach will prove costly for America’s national security, prosperity, and way of life.
Yukos Now, Russia's Economy Later
Just as familiarity breeds contempt, success often spawns complacency.
Sadly, that seems to be the case in Russia, where the government has chosen the first period of prolonged economic growth since communism's fall--with the budget in surplus and capital flight seemingly reversed--to re-open the oligarch wars of the 1990's.
Optimists beware: the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky--and the freezing of his shares in oil giant Yukos--will have a profound long-term impact on Russia's economy and on relations between business and government.
The Yukos imbroglio will not bring Russia's economy to a screeching halt, because no single company determines the country's fate. But long-term prospects are certain to deteriorate.
The problem is one of trust between the business community and the government, which in recent years had just begun to develop.
To put it bluntly, violating that fledgling trust will break the back of Russia's economic upswing.
"Operation Clean Hands"--what some are calling the investigations into Khodorkovsky and his associates--will not increase tax revenue, but only spur growth in the informal economy, as businessmen try to conceal their affairs even more completely from the government.
After all, once Russia's richest man can be stripped of his assets at any moment, ordinary Russian businessmen may be forgiven for concluding that operating in the open is risky.
The first signs of this realization will probably take the form of an increase in capital flight.
Until the Yukos affair, capital flight was reversing.
After a decade of hemorrhaging capital, the first half of this year saw data indicating that Russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at home.
If capital flight resumes, it will quickly snowball if President Putin fails to convince people that the Yukos affair is an isolated case.
I believe that capital flight will increase substantially.
Reduced business activity, with long-term investment projects being cancelled, seems just as certain.
A lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevitable.
Nor am I alone.
Independent Russian economic experts are unanimous in sharing this grim conclusion.
Only people linked to the regime appear to differ.
If investment stalls, President Putin will have no hope of doubling the size of the economy within a decade, as he has promised.
My longstanding skepticism about this promise has now hardened into certainty: the Yukos affair will make it impossible to sustain the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the seizure of his assets has dealt a devastating blow to business confidence.
Indeed, times have changed dramatically since the cutthroat Russian capitalism of the 1990's--supposedly a world in which entrepreneurs were indifferent, at best, to each other's problems.
That caricature, if ever true, is certainly not true today: the business community's negative reaction to the persecution of Khodorkovsky by the law enforcement agencies has been strong and nearly unanimous.
The growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic crime are viewed by the business community as both a mockery of the legal code and a veiled threat that the prosecutors want their cut of Russia's riches.
The improved image of Russia's legal system is in tatters.
Today, the business community understands that the Prosecutor General's Office can find any pretext to go after any one of them.
If prosecutors can treat huge businesses so roughly, what hope is there for medium and small businesses?
No surprise, then, that owners of companies of all sizes are now forming a united front to protect their interests.
President Putin, meanwhile, steadfastly refuses to discuss the Yukos affair or the actions of the law enforcement agencies with Russia's business community.
His silence clearly implies consent to the actions of the prosecutors.
But if the president will not publicly account for the fidelity of Russia's law enforcement agencies to law, who will?
One of the great flaws of Putin's presidency has been to allow law enforcement agencies to evaluate their own actions.
Of course, they invariably conclude that their actions were right and lawful.
So the president's position is clear and he will not back down.
In fact, only businesspeople may now be able to influence events: a sharp and pronounced slowdown, with Russian capital showing its displeasure by voting with its feet, might be the last hope for turning the prosecutors from their chosen course.
But I see no reason for optimism.
On the contrary, the arrest of Khodorkovsky has only whetted the prosecutors' appetite.
Once they have digested Yukos, they will look for another meal.
After that, can anyone seriously doubt that the craving for fresh prey will intensify?
(DE) Mr President, speaking also on behalf of the Austrian People's Party delegation, let me say that there are several reasons why I voted against this report.
One is the demand contained in it for persons who have entered the European Union illegally to be accorded equal rights with - or, indeed, more rights than - legal immigrants as regards such things as the right to accommodation, family benefits, health care and access to educational institutions.
The report also presses for new grounds for the grant of asylum, for example to a person who has been forced into marriage or has agreed to what is termed an arranged marriage.
Giving in to these demands will do nothing to solve problems, but will instead create new ones, for measures like these do in fact exert a suction effect, attracting even more illegal immigrants.

European commission to help finance Aceh peace accord
The grant was made available from the Commission's special "Rapid Reaction Mechanism" and covers the cost of up to 50 international peace monitors for a period of six months.

Opening of new terminal for Sofia Airport co-financed by the EU
Commissioner Hübner stated: "
This airport is the main gateway into Bulgaria and thus provides a very visible link to the EU and the rest of the world at this very important moment - its accession to the EU.
The new runway which is not part of the ISPA project is co-financed by the Kuwait Fund.
Sofia airport currently handles just under 2 million passengers per annum.
Traffic has grown rapidly in recent years (around 70% since 2001) and strong growth is expected to continue following the accession of Bulgaria to the EU.
During development the obligations imposed on airports by EU legislation in the fields of border controls, customs and security have been observed.
The works contract for the construction of the terminal was awarded at the end of 2002 to the Austrian company Strabag International GmbH.
Construction work started in 2003.

Mr President, in addressing the subject of the report on organ donation, I wish to pay tribute to my former assistant, James Sullivan, who, as many of you will know, died tragically on 10 February.
In our office on 8 February, James and Aoife, another assistant, talked about presumed consent and agreed that should anything happen to either of them - both young people - they would donate their organs.
We were not to know that tragically that night James would fall, and that on the Sunday the life-support machine would be switched off.
It is a tribute to James that there are people across the European Union who now live because of his generosity.
For his parents, Edna and Tom, in Cork in Ireland, who mourn his passing and who will never recover from his loss, the only hope they can hold on to is that James is no longer with us but that, owing to his generosity, others have lived.
Obviously, this is a very personal report for our office, and I support it fully.
We believe that the adopted resolution falls well short of what, in our view, origin marking should be, which is to say, among other things, an instrument to protect industrial jobs in Europe, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, and an instrument to tackle social and environmental dumping.
That is why we abstained.
Furthermore, this resolution overlooks the consequences that liberalising world trade has for jobs and the industrial fabric in the various Member States.
It overlooks countless relocations in search of easy profit and their consequences, such as the deindustrialisation of vast regions, rising unemployment and worsening of economic and social conditions.
This resolution only goes as far as calling on the Commission and the Council 'to take all necessary steps to ensure a level playing field'.
Lastly, we regret that the majority in Parliament has rejected the proposals we tabled, which, among other things, sought to preserve jobs, respect workers' and consumers' rights, fight child labour or slavery and oppose the importing of products from occupied territories, and which insisted on the need to withdraw European aid from companies and investors that relocate their production.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution which would see Montenegro achieve candidate status for the European Union.
It also highlights the issues of equality and corruption which need to be tackled within Montenegro and calls for measures to be taken to tackle these problems.
The report sets out some general principles regarding good communication between Parliament and the Commission when international air agreements are adopted and regarding the development of common methods for evaluating those agreements.
Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has gained additional powers and corresponding responsibilities, and must now monitor the conduct of negotiations and the conclusion of air agreements more closely.
Given the importance of such agreements, especially in terms of guaranteeing better services for passengers and new opportunities for operators, it is a good idea for Parliament to inform the Commission of its concerns and its assessment criteria at the outset, without waiting until the negotiations have been concluded.
The Treaty of Lisbon gave Parliament greater rights, one of which is that Parliament's consent is required for concluding international agreements.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism quite often has to assess and deal with various aviation agreements.
I think that this report will significantly aid and simplify the work of the Committee on Transport and Tourism because it highlights the general principles of how we should assess aviation agreements, both in terms of content and in terms of measures.
Moreover, this report will help clarify the various aviation agreements and process them in the simplest way, and it states which criteria we should pay attention to and which aspects we should keep track of.
In addition, this report will help in applying the process of how to move forward with these aviation agreements and what stages will be needed as the various institutions deal with them.
I think that this report is necessary, and I therefore supported its adoption.
in writing. - This report provides for a framework to be established in order that Parliament can undertake its obligations under the Lisbon Treaty in regard to international air agreements.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism were keen to ensure that in dealing with individual agreements with individual sovereign countries, Parliament used the same procedures and guidelines for rapporteurs to work with in order to give us a consistent approach and to give us the opportunity to consider important aspects, including relevant safety and social conditions.
I shall be voting in favour and would hope that Parliament can support my report so that the proposed framework can be put into operation
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has institutionalised new areas in which Parliament's approval is necessary for the conclusion of international agreements.
Agreements on air transport fall into this category, as they are part of the ordinary legislative procedure.
This requires Parliament to be kept regularly informed, in order to ensure a concerted evaluation of the whole negotiation process, and so that it can express its opinions and priorities at the same time.
This report contains guidelines on how air agreements should be analysed in terms of content and procedures to be adopted.
Three categories of agreement are presented which cover different objectives, namely, horizontal agreements, comprehensive agreements and safety agreements.
I am voting in favour of this agreement as I consider it essential that the position adopted by the European Commission, and stressed in this report, expresses the fact that Parliament should regularly monitor the entire process through the sharing of information, and that the Commission should submit a report analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the existing agreements at least every three years.
The agreements should be adopted through a fruitful interinstitutional agreement that enables the European institutions to participate actively in them.
I voted in favour of Mr Simpson's report on international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon, bearing in mind that Parliament now has a greater share of responsibility when it comes to negotiating international agreements.
Furthermore, agreements on air transport with third countries help to develop international air transport and safeguard security of law.
I would like to inform you that the Conference of the Presidents has just adopted its proposals on the membership of the Equitable Life Assurance Society Committee of Inquiry and of the Temporary Committee on extraordinary rendition.
These proposals have been sent to all Members by e-mail and are now on Parliament’s website.
The deadline for tabling amendments is this morning at 10.30 a.m. and the vote will take place today at 12.00 noon.
Brussels, 10 February 2010
Aid under this scheme is limited in time and takes the form of subsidized loans.
The scheme is open to farmers active in the primary agricultural production, provided they are not in difficulty.
In particular, the Romanian authorities demonstrated that it is necessary, proportional and appropriate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy.
Moreover, the calculation method of the aid element is compatible with the provisions of the Temporary framework.
The Commission therefore considered that the scheme can be approved under Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The full text of the Commission decision will be published in the State Aid Register on DG Competition’s website under the reference number SA 31 478 (N 372/2010).
. I find myself in agreement and sympathy with the point the honourable Member makes.
The British Government, even before assuming the office of the Presidency of the European Union, argued for the need for a period of reflection.
We did not feel it was appropriate for any one government to make a unilateral declaration as to the status of the draft Constitutional Treaty, given the fact that the Constitutional Treaty was owned by the totality of the members of the European Union.
It is right to recognise that, even before the decisive votes in France and the Netherlands, there had been, in the case of Spain, a referendum which had found in favour of the draft Constitutional Treaty and a whole range of other countries had in turn ratified the draft Constitutional Treaty by parliamentary procedure.
That is why I hold to the position that was first articulated immediately prior to the British Presidency.
During our Presidency we have maintained that position.
In the course of that Presidency our Prime Minister has made clear his personal judgement that he believes it is necessary to get the politics in a better place before returning to the institutional question.
But in the course of this Presidency we have also made it clear that we regard it as necessary to have the kind of practical, sensible reforms that will allow a Union of 25 to operate more effectively than on the basis of the present Treaty arrangements.
New EU statutory audit rules become applicable today, which will contribute to boosting confidence in the financial sector.
This new regime will help promote high-quality audits throughout the EU and will enhance investor trust in the financial information of companies, thereby supporting the conditions for cross-border investment and economic growth in the Union.
The European Parliament and Council already adopted the new rules in April 2014.
In the last two years, the Commission has worked closely with Member States, national audit supervisors and stakeholders to smooth the path to implementation and facilitate the transition to the new regime.
Background:
Auditors will now also have a strong mandate to be independent and to exert professional scepticism regarding the management of the audited company.
For example, in the case of PIEs, auditors will rotate on a regular basis and will no longer be allowed to provide certain non-audit services to their audit clients.
Finally, the new rules will strengthen the coordination of audit supervision throughout the Union, with the establishment of the Committee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEAOB).

The Fall of the Berlin Wall and Social Democracy
CAMBRIDGE – It was already clear 30 years ago that the fall of the Berlin Wall would change everything.
But precisely what that change will mean for world politics in the twenty-first century still remains to be seen.
Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.
The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.
If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.
By 1989, the Soviet Union, and communism generally, had condemned tens of millions of people to poverty, and had clearly failed to compete with the Western economic model.
Over four decades, the Cold War had taken millions of lives in various theaters around the world (where the conflict was much hotter than its name suggests), and created a pretext for repression and elite dominance in dozens of countries across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
Yet for all its positive implications, the post-Cold War era also upended the Western social-democratic compact: the system of safety nets, regulations, universal public services, redistributive tax policies, and labor-market institutions that had long protected workers and the less fortunate.
According to the political scientist Ralf Dahrendorf (as quoted by the late Tony Judt), that policy consensus had signified “the greatest progress which history has seen so far.”
Not only had it limited and then reduced inequality in most advanced economies; it also contributed to decades of sustained growth.
The economic growth of the post-war era was born of broadly competitive markets, which had been created through regulations to break the backs of monopolies and powerful conglomerates.
It also depended on a generously supported system of public education and government-funded innovation.
The proliferation of high-paying good jobs during this period was the result of labor-market institutions that prevented employers from wielding excessive powers over their employees; without such constraints, firms would have generated low-wage jobs with harsh working conditions.
Social democracy played an equally important role in politics.
Its redistributive institutions and welfare-state programs could not have survived without non-elites wielding political power.
Broad-based political participation was achieved through reforms to expand the franchise and deepen democratic processes.
It was supported by powerful political parties, such as the Swedish Workers’ Party, and trade unions. And it was driven by universalist ideas that motivated people to support and defend democracy.
In many ways, the United States was no different from its Western European counterparts.
Throughout the New Deal and post-war eras, it enthusiastically busted trusts and reined in the political influence of the wealthy.
It instituted government-administered old-age and disability pensions (Social Security), unemployment benefits, and redistributive taxation, and adopted various anti-poverty measures.
While deploying anti-socialist language, it nonetheless adopted social democracy with American characteristics – which meant, among other things, that its social safety net was weaker than in other countries.
None of this can be understood in the absence of communism.
After all, social-democratic movements emerged from communist parties, many of which – including the Social Democrats in post-war Germany and the French Socialist Party – did not abandon socialist rhetoric until well into the 1960s, or even the 1980s.
While the parties that proved most successful in creating new labor-market institutions, securing high-quality public services, and reaching a broad social consensus, such as the Swedish Workers’ Party or the British Labour Party, had typically repudiated their earlier Marxism, they still spoke the same language as their Marxist cousins.
More to the point, elites themselves embraced the social-democratic compact as a means of preventing communist revolution.
It was this anti-communist mode of social democracy that motivated intellectuals such as the economist John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the post-war order, and political leaders from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in the US.
Similarly, the threat of communism (from North Korea) drove South Korean leaders to pursue ambitious land reforms and investments in education, while tolerating some degree of union activity despite their desire to keep wages low.
But when communism collapsed – both as an economic system and as an ideology – it knocked the legs out from under the social-democratic stool.
Suddenly faced with the need to invent a new, equally inclusive, equally universalist ideology, the left proved unequal to the task.
And at the same time, the leaders of an already ascendant right interpreted the collapse of communism as a signal (and an opportunity) to roll back social democracy in favor of the market.
Yet, for a number of reasons, the embrace of this agenda in much of the West was mistaken.
For starters, it ignored the contribution that the welfare state, labor-market institutions, and government investments in research and development had made to post-war growth.
Second, it failed to anticipate that dismantling social-democratic institutions would weaken democracy itself, by further empowering incumbent politicians and the wealthy (who would become much wealthier in the process).
And, third, it ignored the lessons of the interwar years, when the absence of broad-based economic opportunities and strong safety nets had created the conditions for the rise of left- and right-wing extremism.
US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may have envisioned a world with more efficient markets and less bureaucratic controls.
But the political revolution they launched has culminated in the presidency of Donald Trump in the US and a Boris Johnson-led government in the United Kingdom.
The social-democratic compact now needs to be refashioned for the twenty-first century.
To that end, we need to recognize the problems facing advanced economies, from uncontrolled deregulation and finance run amok to the structural changes brought about by globalization and automation.
We also need to form a new political coalition that is broad enough to include industrial workers, who remain among the most politically active segments of the population, even as their numbers have fallen.
But, most important, we must recognize that curtailing the power of big companies; providing universal public services, including health care and high-quality education; protecting workers and preventing the rise of low-wage, precarious employment; and investing in R&D are not just policies that should be evaluated in terms of their economic consequences.
They are the essence of the social-democratic project, and the foundation of a prosperous and stable society.
Brussels, 16 September 2002
The establishment of an European Public Prosecutor is one of the main subjects for the European Commission.
At the end of the period of public consultation announced in the Green Paper, the Commission is holding a public hearing on the subject.
The Public Hearing will then be brought to a conclusion by a general debate.
Mrs Schreyer will deliver a closing address.
To date about 70 detailed written comments have been received from authorities, interested groups and individuals.
These comments as well as the Green Paper itself can be consulted at the following website.

BSE: Commission will adopt special market measures for beef
It may equally be applied in the other Member States if there is a week market for cows.
Therefore purchases shall only be made, through tender procedure, in Member States where the price for cows is below the trigger price during a period of two weeks.
This trigger-price is fixed for each Member State.
The Community financing of purchases is fixed at 70% of the price for the meat.
Be it for storage, be it for processing through rendering, no fixed quantities per Member States apply.
The new measure will enter into force following the formal adoption by the Commission in the days to come.
The special measures under the new scheme shall apply until the end of 2001.
We are living up to our social responsibility towards the farm community.
But it is not the way forward.
The beef production of the future must be sustainable - socially, environmentally and ethically.
The Commission has already started its reflections.
We will bring forward our long-term vision within the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy in the first half of 2002."
Purchases may only be made in Member States recording prices for cows below the trigger price during a period of two weeks.
The EU will finance 70% of the purchase expenditures.
All other costs related to the beef purchase scheme shall be borne by the Member State concerned.
Today the management committee also decided to buy into public intervention 30,796 tonnes of male beef (Belgium 100 t, Spain 14,572 t, France 7,739 t, Italy 7,145 t, Austria 810 t, Germany 430 t).

Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to continue the discussion regarding Parliament’s discharge.
Parliament’s budget for 2004 was EUR 1 231 million.
If Parliament had just one language and just one place of business, 60% of this expenditure would be saved.
Holding Parliament’s plenary part-sessions in Strasbourg costs more than EUR 200 million.
Of that, some EUR 10 million is spent on rent for the Salvador de Madariaga and Winston Churchill buildings.
Parliament receives 20% of all EU administrative expenditure for its own use.
That is such a lot of money that not all of it can be easily spent.
At the end of last year, there was an EUR 85 million surplus of cash remaining in Parliament’s budget, a surplus for which a use had to be quickly thought up.
The Bureau finally proposed the purchase of the Madariaga and Churchill buildings.
These were owned by SCI-Erasme, a Dutch pension fund, or its subsidiary.
Parliament, however, paid rent to the city of Strasbourg.
During the purchase negotiations, it emerged that for a quarter of a century the city had been charging Parliament more than it paid to Erasme.
The city of Strasbourg was therefore cashing in on the fact that Parliament had its premises in the city.
The city has refused to say how much extra money was generated in this way.
This situation is intolerable.
Our group supports a full and thorough investigation into this.
With that purpose in mind, we are prepared to reject Mr Ferber’s report and refer it back to the Committee for further deliberation.
Because of the new areas of confusion that have emerged, we ought to do the same with regard to the report on discharge for the Committee of the Regions drafted by Mr Lundgren.
2. Murder of women in Mexico and Central America (vote)
- Report: Raül Romeva i Rueda
- before the vote on Amendment 6:
Madam President, I have risen to speak in this debate on amendments to the 2005 budget and the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument because I believe that the proposals contained in the Garriga Polledo and Böge reports will enable the European Union to honour the commitments it has entered into vis-à-vis the countries hit by the tsunami.
I should like to take this opportunity to draw Members’ attention to three problems of a more general nature.
Firstly, it is an unfortunate fact that natural disasters of various types, all of which result in enormous human and material losses, are becoming an ever more frequent occurrence.
The Asian tsunami, the hurricane in Slovakia, the floods in Austria, Romania and Germany, the fires in Spain and Portugal and the recent disaster in the United States are merely some of the disasters that have happened this year.
What this means is that we must set aside significantly more funding in future EU budgets to enable us to provide assistance to countries affected by natural disasters.
Secondly, promises of assistance are easy enough to make, but a great deal more difficult to put into action.
A good example of this is the funding for areas suffering the consequences of the Asian tsunami, which is an issue that has already been raised today.
The European Union pledged EUR 350 million to this cause, but is still attempting to find sources of funding to meet this commitment, which after all is not excessively high.
Thirdly, I would draw the House’s attention to the overly long procedures that are in place for organising funding to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters.
A good example of this is the aid for Slovakia, where a hurricane destroyed large swathes of forest in the Slovak Tatras.
The hurricane hit the country in autumn 2004, but it is only now, one year later, that we are sending money to Slovakia to help the country cope with the consequences of this natural disaster.
Such criticisms notwithstanding, I am delighted that the European Union is so actively involved in measures across the globe aimed at overcoming the consequences of natural disasters.
I am quite sure that this House’s adoption of the Garriga Polledo and Böge reports, which we are debating today, will help ensure that money is made available more rapidly for such matters.
Mr President, as you said just a moment ago, Charles Taylor, who is accused of war crimes, has been brought before the UN War Tribunal in Sierra Leone.
As Chief Observer of the European Union's election observation mission in Liberia, I have urged the newly elected President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to insist on extradition.
She agreed to this, provided that the Nigerian President and the African Union would lend their support.
The arrest and bringing before the law of Charles Taylor is a triumph for the new Liberia and for not only the African Union, but certainly also for the EU, both of which have passed this test with flying colours.
This reflects credit on the work we did there.
Since the arrest, a shadow has disappeared from over western Africa and the region has been given a chance of peace and a chance to develop democracy.
As Chief Observer of the election observation mission in Liberia, I warmly support the idea of the chairmen inviting her to speak here before the plenary, and I hope that in the meantime, the EU will continue to lend its strong support to the Millennium Objectives and democratisation in that country, for that is what the citizens over there deserve right now.
Financing the Next Development Agenda
WASHINGTON, DC – As the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals approaches, the United Nations is intensifying its efforts to foster debate about what comes next for promotion of development worldwide.
The outcome of these discussions will shape policies and investment aimed at spurring GDP growth, strengthening human capital, and promoting more inclusive prosperity.
With the global population expected to reach nine billion people by 2050 – a significant proportion of whom will reside in developing or underdeveloped countries – the international community must improve access to education, health care, and employment opportunities worldwide.
Meanwhile, the prospect of a rise in global temperature of more than 2°C (3.6°F) over pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (which would trigger global warming’s most damaging effects) calls for higher investment in sustainable urbanization, climate-smart agriculture, and social safety nets.
Both factors challenge us to define, in the longer term, more sustainable patterns of production and consumption.
Governments, civil society, and the private sector must rise to the challenge, cooperating to find and implement creative solutions.
But, first, they must anticipate the associated financing requirements, which will soon surpass the current capacities of governments and international donors, and take action now to activate new, reliable sources of financing.
To start, governments should design targeted, evidence-based policies and support the development of sound institutions.
This would make government services more effective, while helping to catalyze additional development aid from traditional donors and mobilize private-sector resources.
In many countries, there is considerable scope for domestic resource mobilization.
Broadening the tax base, improving tax administration, and closing gaps in the value-added tax could make a significant difference in lower-income countries, where tax revenues account for only about 10-14% of GDP, compared to 20-30% of GDP in high-income countries.
More equitable taxation would have a positive impact on governance, another important tool for mobilizing domestic resources.
With improved corporate and public governance and clear transfer-pricing policies, resource-rich countries could shore up their capacity to negotiate fair contracts with extractive industries, balance revenues and expenditures over time, and manage their natural endowments more transparently.
Progress in these areas would help governments to channel their spending more effectively toward those who would benefit the most.
For example, only 8% of the $409 billion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20% of the population.
A targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending, freeing up resources for education, health, and poverty eradication.
Furthermore, promoting financial deepening and inclusiveness could accelerate private-sector growth, creating more opportunities.
Indeed, broader access to financial services would help the estimated 400 million micro, small, and medium-size enterprises in developing countries to prosper, while enabling the 2.5 billion people worldwide who currently lack access to such services to build their assets.
A deeper and more efficient financial sector would also reduce transaction costs and facilitate risk management.
Local-currency bond markets could help to develop domestic investor bases and mobilize domestic savings to support long-term investments.
At the same time, the international community should work to improve the availability and effectiveness of official development assistance.
The ODA target of 0.7% of GDP – agreed in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico – should motivate countries to increase their contributions.
They can also take steps to make ODA more predictable from year to year.
Donors should structure aid to ensure that it supports sound national development policies and programs, rather than their own narrow interests.
This is particularly relevant as emerging development partners, especially the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), offer new kinds of aid packages that incorporate investment and non-financial assistance.
Private charities, which have been instrumental in promoting innovation in fields such as health care, the environment, and education, could provide valuable insight into channeling aid more effectively.
More generally, improving coordination among donors would help to maximize the impact of aid on the ground.
While ODA remains an important source of financing for fragile and very-low-income countries, it represents only 7% of net financial flows to developing countries, where foreign direct investment, remittances, long-term debt, and portfolio investment have a larger impact.
Donors should leverage aid to “grow the pie” and to diversify financing sources for the world’s poorest countries by providing risk guarantees, innovative investment vehicles, debt syndication, and co-financing arrangements.
Attracting even a fraction of the assets held by institutional investors, sovereign-wealth funds, and public pension funds could boost development finance substantially.
Diaspora populations are another major potential source of development financing.
Reducing transfer costs, which average an estimated 9% of the value of transactions, would put more money into the hands of those who need it most.
Tailoring financial products for diaspora communities could attract resources for investment, while reinforcing migrants’ ties – economic and otherwise – to their home countries.
Finally, the international community bears a special responsibility for delivering global public goods.
The responsibility to preserve the environment, stem the spread of communicable diseases, strengthen the international financial architecture, enhance developing-country participation in the global trading system, and facilitate the exchange of knowledge lies at the intersection of national development priorities and global interests.
Duty-free, quota-free access to OECD markets, complemented by simpler, more transparent rules of origin, would raise GDP by 1% in the least-developed countries, lifting millions out of poverty.
Investment in statistical capacity would help governments and businesses worldwide to make better policy decisions, based on a more accurate accounting of the associated costs and benefits.
The challenge of the post-2015 development agenda lies in finding creative solutions to support prosperity, equality, and sustainability.
Together, governments, civil society, international organizations, and the private sector can improve the availability and quality of finance for development, and shape a better future for all.
Materials made of particles which measure less than 10-9 m are called nanomaterials.
They occur in free form or as nanoparticle emissions in a matrix of other materials, such as composites.
These are nanomaterials obtained with 'top-down' technology and the use of high-energy attrition.
Nanoparticles have a high surface area and significant surface energy, which give them the following characteristics:
ability to catalyse chemical reactions;
significant reactivity (potential);
can easily penetrate living cells.
Uncontrolled release of free nanoparticles into the environment may be hazardous to health.
Free nanoparticles of various materials may cause carcinogenic chemical reactions if they enter living cells, but this has not been confirmed.
Sources of nanoparticles released into the environment include:
products manufactured by the 'top-down' method, for example nano zinc oxide particles used in UV filter creams, and bacteriocidal additives such as silver nanoparticles;
unintended by-products in the form of nanoparticles, for example as a result of combustion, friction of tyres, and other uncontrolled processes which create nanoaerosols by Brownian motion.
Will the use of nanoparticles in sun lotions, whose purpose is to block ultraviolet radiation, cause side effects on health?
This can and should be investigated.
Does the catalytic action of the nanoaerosols which are all around us have dangerous effects on health?
This, too, requires urgent scientific research, which, however, is difficult to conduct, for physical and chemical reasons.
I would like to point out that the Community's Ecolabel will establish a common basis for its use, but it should not be allowed to prevent other kinds of labelling.
I think it is important that we should be able to attach a label to a product showing it has been produced in the country in which it is being sold, and I disapprove of the Commission's position in banning that in Community-financed campaigns.
Notification of the country of origin in local food production, for example, is the best sort of Ecolabel.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.35 and resumed at 11.00.)
(PL) Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak in such an important debate.
The citizens of the European Union need the European institutions to be effective in many areas, including in prevention of the spread of every kind of disease in every part of the European Union, and this is understandable.
However, above all else, preventative agencies working in the area of health and food safety should be ready with ways of preventing panic.
These institutions should be completely independent of the administrations of Member States, and should even be empowered to act with executive authority in the event of a crisis.
We did not manage to prevent panic this time.
This has resulted in losses running into millions, and Polish farmers have also been affected.
The price of vegetables on the Polish market fell by two thirds in the course of a week.
Every day, vegetable producers incur losses of PLN 2 million.
Several months ago, we raised the alarm concerning swine flu.
The European institutions did not pass muster then and were not able to prevent panic from spreading across the European Union.
Now, something similar has happened.
Brussels, 17 October 2007l
Questions and Answers on IUU Fishing
What is meant by Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing?
The only internationally agreed definition of "IUU fishing" is to be found in the FAO's IUU Action Plan.
In line with this definition, and for the sake of clarity, the Commission considers that the scope of the EU policy to deter, prevent and eliminate IUU fishing should cover:
behaviours infringing applicable rules on the management and conservation of fisheries resources, occurring in waters subject to or beyond the jurisdiction of a State;
fishing activities carried out in a high seas area and subject to a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) by fishing vessels without flag or flying the flag of States not party to the RFMO and in a manner contravening the rules issued by this organisation;
and fishing activities carried out in a high seas area not subject to any conservation and management measures in a manner inconsistent with State responsibilities for the conservation of fisheries resources under international law.
The policy of the EU against IUU fishing shall therefore encompass fishing activities occurring within EU waters as well as beyond those waters.
Why is IUU fishing a threat to sustainable fisheries?
By definition, IUU fishing means that catches are either misreported, or not reported at all, to the relevant public authorities.
Come forms of IUU activity specifically target juveniles, which would otherwise be protected by rules on minimum sizes, or are carried out during periods or in areas which are normally closed, thus jeopardizing the renewal of the fish stocks concerned.
When stocks are already outside safe biological limits, IUU practices can act as the trigger for further, dramatic consequences.
A good example of this is the case of blue fin tuna in the Mediterranean, where the IUU catch has been estimated to be running at such a high level that it could soon bring the stock to the brink of extinction if allowed to proceed unchecked.
Does IUU fishing damage the marine environment in other ways?
The environmental consequences of IUU fishing go well beyond the direct damage done to fish stocks.
These practices also represent a serious threat to marine ecosystems and habitats.
In particular, fishing with prohibited methods can result in a high proportion of unwanted species being taken as by-catch and then discarded.
How do IUU activities affect the livelihoods of honest fishermen?
This problem has worsened over the last years with the globalisation of the fisheries sector, which has led to increased trade flows of fisheries products whose legality is difficult to ascertain.
How are these effects felt outside the EU?
Coastal developing countries often lack the means and capacity to manage and control properly the maritime waters under their jurisdiction.
Unscrupulous illegal operators take advantage of those weaknesses to pursue fishing activities without authorization from the coastal States and to plunder resources which are vital to local fishermen.
What about the ordinary crew members who are work on IUU vessels?
Some firms who practice illegal fishing, including EU operators, operate substandard vessels flying the flag of States which either do not apply any standards of social protection or do so only at a very low level.
Why do operators choose to fish illegally?
The major motive for IUU activities is the potential for high profits.
The operating costs of firms involved in illegal fishing are generally lower than those of the average fishing firm operating legally.
Costs resulting from social and tax charges can be reduced to a minimum or may even be non-existent for fleets engaged in IUU activities under cover of offshore companies or flags of convenience.
Non-respect of fisheries rules and trading of catches outside official channels also translate into reduced expenses.
Another reason for IUU activity is the overcapacity of certain fishing fleets in relation to the fishing possibilities available.
Some vessels will exceed the catch limits to which they are subject in order to maintain a level of catch that can keep their business profitable.
What is a 'flag of convenience'?
Under the Law of the Sea, the duty to exert control over a vessel is primarily incumbent upon the Flag State.
Registration in States hosting "flags of convenience" is generally a very simple and inexpensive operation.
This then encourages flag-hopping, where vessels regularly change flags in order to benefit from the least demanding regimes and make it more difficult for inspection and control services to keep track of them.
To deal with this phenomenon, both Port States and Market States have at their disposal a number of instruments which can significantly reduce the incentives provided by such "Flags of non-compliance", but so far adequate use has not been made of these instruments.
What will the new regulation add compared to existing EU legislation?
IUU fishing is by essence an international activity.
International trade in fisheries products has grown considerably as part of the economic globalization, and this has provided illegal operators with many lucrative new opportunities.
In some instances, the complexity and scale of these activities can rightly be qualified as a form of cross-border organised crime, whose working methods and patterns resemble those of other similar activities, such as drug trafficking or large-scale contraband.
The main shortcoming of the current EU regime is precisely that it is not comprehensive enough to address the complex, transnational nature of IUU fishing.
We need an integrated approach to address these activities throughout the whole supply chain (from the net to the plate).
There is an urgent need for the EU to close these gaps.
The measures proposed in the new draft IUU regulation should effectively close the doors of the EU to illegal fisheries products and vessels, and thereby reduce the economic incentives for IUU operators to harvest and trade illicit fisheries products.
Is the EU alone in taking this approach?
No.
There is a growing international consensus on the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to IUU activities, as expressed in decisions of the FAO, the UN General Assembly and the OECD.
It is clear that stronger control systems, which cover the whole chain from net to plate, will in future be the standard.
The regulation is also one of the first actions to be taken under the EU's new integrated maritime policy, which has received strong support from Member States, regional governments and stakeholders throughout Europe.
What other measures does the Commission aim to introduce to combat IUU actitivies?
The Communication identifies a number of key actions, all of which will be necessary to effectively close the net on IUU fishing:
Require all fishing products (including processed products) entering the European Union to be certified by the Flag state as having been caught legally.
The regime governing access and landing in Community ports by third country fishing and transport vessels will be adapted to reflect this policy. (See above.)
Enable the EU to adopt retaliation measures against States and vessels which repeatedly and obviously breach international rules on fisheries conservation and management measures.
The procedure for identifying the States must be transparent and respect their right to make their views heard.
The measures taken by the EU would take the form of commercial sanctions, ban on access to European ports for vessels flying the flag of the country concerned, prohibition for European Union nationals to maintain economic relationships with the fishing industry of the States concerned.
Increase financial sanctions for serious breaches of rules on fishing and trade in illegal catches.
Financial sanctions must reach a level that deters fraudsters and could be matched with other sanctions such as the confiscation of catches or vessels and/or the withdrawal of licences.
Take stronger measures to prevent the participation of European Union nationals in IUU fishing activities.
Step up cooperation with international partners to improve monitoring, control and surveillance of IUU activities.
Take action within the RFMOs to improve the fight against illegal fishing and enhance cooperation between these organisations.
Increase support for the developing countries to improve control and management in their national waters.
Brussels, 4 July 2003
Local and regional authorities must be a driving force in implementing the Structural Funds after 2006
In view of the need to reformulate economic and social cohesion policy in an enlarged Europe, the Commission asked the Committee of the Regions to draw up an outlook report on Governance and simplification of the Structural Funds after 2006, which it will take into account when preparing its report on economic and social cohesion for publication in December 2003.
Enlargement is likely to increase those imbalances.
This would also make administration considerably easier.
The regions also deplore the fact that other Community policies are applied without direct reference to cohesion policies.
The rapporteurs, Raffaele Fitto (IT/EPP) and Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe (BE/PES), note that this leads to a loss of efficiency and synergies.
Finally, the CoR proposes that a single legal framework be introduced for the financial management of the programmes.
Modernisation of Social Protection
The ESC could be involved in the preparatory work and the report.
Where appropriate, the European Parliament, the ESC and the COR could take part as observers in the meetings of the committee of national experts.
To that end, the Committee is ready to lend all its support to the bench-marking process in conjunction with the European Parliament.
.
The contamination of animal feed can have the consequence of impairing food intended for human consumption.
The case of BSE is a good example, in which the use of animal meal led to one of the most serious food crises ever seen in the European Union.
The same could be said of nitrofurans, dioxins, the hormone MPA (medroxy-progesterone acetate), or of antibiotics, with consequences, upstream, for human health.
We are facing an extreme case today in the shape of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) because the meat or milk of cattle fed with products containing GMOs are not covered by the labelling and traceability procedures.
I believe that the principle of primary responsibility for compliance with food legislation and food safety lies with the animal feed businesses.
In conjunction with traceability, this principle could allow for rapid action that would put an end to risks to human and animal health and to the environment.
Nevertheless, how we ensure the financial liability of operators whose activities cause economic damage to the animal feed sector is a key issue, bearing in mind that these operators are frequently supported by public funds.
The Commission proposes that there should be a financial guarantee, in this case an insurance, although we have reservations about this point, because an assessment must first be made of the socio-economic impact of this measure, which must not invalidate an effective system of financial liability.
There must be monitoring and the law must be observed.
in writing. - I voted 'yes' at the final vote on this resolution.
It needs to be said that there has been an informal meeting with the Council and the Commission, where it became clear that Parliament could agree to the procedure.
The draft report submitted to vote by Jo Leinen takes over the COM proposal and amendments have been tabled in the ENVI Committee.
The Council already agreed it would approve Parliament's position; thus, a first-reading agreement is to be assumed.
We Greens agree with the procedure.
A Vote against Voting in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD -- As Pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on February 18, many observers hope that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government.
But sometimes democracy is best served by refusing to participate.
The upcoming election, to be held under the illegal Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) implemented following President Pervez Musharraf’s state of emergency on November 3, is such a case, which is why my party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote.
To be sure, contesting the election would provide my party with a great opportunity to take issues to the people.
In fact, my party’s support has been growing, with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most popular in the frontier province – and gaining ground in every other province.
But elections by themselves don’t bring democracy.
Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, loves elections.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been holding elections for 27 years.
Uzbekistan’s Islam Karimov has been in power for 30 years, and has just been “elected” to a fresh seven-year presidential term.
Elections are meaningful only if they are perceived to be free and fair, which requires independent referees.
When my party started eleven years ago, we called ourselves the Movement For Justice.
We demanded an independent judiciary, because we believed that democracy and prosperity are impossible without the rule of law, and that the rule of law requires a judiciary that can act as a constraint on the government.
Having gone to university in western countries, we were inspired by the American system of check and balances.
So it is a shock to us that the US State Department keeps talking about free and fair elections and abolishing the state of emergency, but without mentioning the reinstatement of the judges – including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court – that Musharraf illegally dismissed.
If the judges are not reinstated, how can there be free and fair elections?
Who decides what is free and fair?
Musharraf?
This is where the battle lines are now drawn, and where the future of the country will be decided.
If the Chief Justice and the judges are reinstated, we can move toward a genuine democratic system.
But if Musharraf manages to get his own PCO judges established in the country, then we will head toward a period of turmoil.
After all, how can the party of a man who has less than 5% support win the election now without rigging it?
Unfortunately, most of the political parties have failed to stand up for the democratic process.
Major parties like the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) have decided to participate, following the lead of the late Benazir Bhutto’s People’s Party.
And, of all the major parties that are contesting the election, only the PMLN is demanding the reinstatement of the judges.
Fortunately, the people of Pakistan – students, opinion makers, and, above all, lawyers – are standing up for the judges, doing the work that should have been done by political parties.
We see lawyers marching, getting beaten up, filling the jails, and yet remaining resolute.
They are suffering huge financial losses by boycotting the courts, and yet they are determined that the Chief Justice must be reinstated.
So the dividing line in Pakistan is not between liberals and extremists, but between those who support the status quo and those who oppose it.
Parties that call themselves democratic are not only going along with Musharraf in this fraudulent election, but are also helping to restore the status quo.
The solution to dysfunctional democracy is not military dictatorship, but more democracy.
Pakistanis understand democracy, because we have a democratic culture.
Our founder was a great constitutionalist, and Pakistan came into being through the vote.
The problem has been that because we have lacked an independent judiciary, we have not had an independent election commission.
So all our elections, except for one in 1970, have been rigged.
India, with which Pakistan shares a similar background, went through 40 years of dysfunctional democracy with a one-party system.
But in the last 16 years it has begun to reap the fruits of genuine democratic competition, because an independent judiciary and electoral commission gives people confidence that their vote can make a difference.
Until we have the same in Pakistan, no election can be free and fair.
For two and a half years, I supported Musharraf and believed his promises to bring genuine democracy to Pakistan.
I’ve learned my lesson about Musharraf.
But, more importantly, no military dictator can succeed where Musharraf has so clearly failed.
Winston Churchill once said, “War is too serious a business for generals.”
The same is true of democracy.
The role of the European Ombudsman is clearly defined as being to investigate complaints against the EU institutions and bodies.
Such powers mean greater transparency in the relations between the European institutions and the citizens, companies, associations and other bodies with a registered office in the EU.
The complaint submitted by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) in question in this report concerns access to documents in the Commission's possession.
The Ombudsman gave the Commission a deadline of three months to submit a detailed opinion, but this occurred only after 15 months.
This behaviour means that the Commission breached its obligation to cooperate with the Ombudsman sincerely and in good faith during his inquiry, and was detrimental not only to interinstitutional dialogue, but also to the EU's public image.
I believe that it is Parliament's responsibility, as the only elected body of the EU, to safeguard and protect the independence of the Ombudsman in fulfilling his duties towards the European public.
.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the consequences of the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 September 2005 relating to Community powers in the area of criminal law are so momentous that this judgment really marks a break in the development of Community law.
It can even be assumed that under certain circumstances this precedent might have a negative effect on the sovereignty of the Member States.
The condition for its application to Community norm-setting arising from the First Pillar of the EU will therefore be strict adherence to the principle of subsidiarity as established in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and in the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
This principle is directly connected to the need for European lawmakers to see that the enactment of criminal sanctions under the First Pillar is an exception, restricted to cases where there is an unavoidable need to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens and the main interests of the EU.
It is also essential that the effects and overall impact of the criminal law norms passed on the basis of the First Pillar are thoroughly and painstakingly monitored and assessed.
Another area where the Commission is proposing criminal sanctions is the protection of intellectual property rights.
This area undoubtedly represents one of the main activities of the Community arising from Article 2 of the EC Treaty.
I think, and I will say it again, that this area is so important and so rapidly developing that it requires a specific conceptual and systematic approach.
I consider it essential to develop a well-rounded concept for protecting intellectual property rights, which will include among other things criminal law measures.
– Mr President, towards the end of your speech you thanked the Group Presidents, but I should also like to remind you of the existence of the Non-attached Members – even though you are well aware of them.
Many Non-attached Members will have asked to speak, and so I shall use the fact that I, together with Mrs Garaud, have represented you over the years in the Conference of Presidents. I shall use this opportunity for the last time to take the floor, not of course as a group, as I naturally respect the nature of this group of the Non-attached, of which we have spoken on so many occasions.
Unfortunately the problems of my group – problems, let us say, of organisation in this Parliament – have not been resolved, although I am not holding it against you personally, Mr President, of course.
Let us say that the group is composed of a few dozen Members and so the next Parliament will need to look at it more carefully.
Speaking for myself, Mr President, and I believe for Mrs Garaud as well, I should like to join in the expressions of admiration and recognition for the role you have played, especially in defence of this Parliament, for the way in which you have run the House, regardless of individual circumstances or the political judgment that each of us might make of your actions.
I too felt I must pay you my respects in this way and offer you my very best wishes for your political and personal future.

State aids: Commission declares compatible the aid linked to stranded costs in the energy sector in Italy
These rules require that state aids should not distort or threaten to distort competition to an extent contrary to the common interest.
The total compensation granted will be no more than €850 million.
They will be granted to ENEL and the companies that have inherited ENEL’s stranded assets.
In recent years, the Commission has approved a number of similar cases concerning aid to cover stranded costs in the energy sector, in Austria, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.
Further cases are currently being analysed by the Commission.
Brussels, 23 October 2002
The Working Group identified six areas in which work will be pursued jointly by European and Iranian experts;
the investment climate in Iran,
technology transfer and co-operation in the non-nuclear energy sector, renewable energies and energy efficiency,
producer-consumer dialogue,
the security of the energy supply networks, interconnections and regional co-operation,
afety and security in the transport sector (maritime, rail and air).
Securing the Future of Energy
PALO ALTO – Today’s huge global energy problems in no small measure reflect the essentially nineteenth-century business plans that three of the world’s largest industries are still pursuing.
Electric utilities still largely burn fossil fuels and sell the power to homes and businesses.
Oil companies still drill for and refine petroleum, and principally sell gasoline and diesel fuel.
Automobile manufacturers still bend steel into vehicles that generally must be powered by petroleum-based fuels.
Until recently, each of these giant industries was comfortable continuing on its familiar and comfortable nineteenth-century path into the twenty-first century.
Each had also succeeded in getting government to insulate it against any need to make fundamental changes.
But recent developments are beginning to create increasingly heavy seas for these industries.
Indeed, many observers detect approaching storms of epic proportions.
What has happened?
First, evidence of climate change has begun to convince almost all climatologists and many other informed observers that our current approach to producing and using energy is very dangerous to the biosphere.
Because changes in carbon dioxide emissions, unlike pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, cannot be easily detected, and because of the multi-century persistence of CO2 in the atmosphere, the problem of reducing its level in the atmosphere is much harder to solve than are other environmental problems.
Nor are we accustomed to dealing with potential exponential climate change, as phenomena such as warming lead to the release of carbon from the tundra, thereby accelerating warming.
Public debate is also confused by an “all-or-nothing” mind-set, with skeptics contending that if any portion of climate change is naturally caused (say, by the earth’s axis tilting over a period of millennia) then none of it can be anthropogenic.
Yet there is every reason for us to try to mitigate at least the anthropogenic portion of the climate change caused by CO 2 emissions and other dangerous practices, such as deforestation.
Moreover, there is deepening concern about two types of energy-related security problems: the increasing risk of violence stemming from the nature of our energy use, and the high cost of that energy.
The main risk of violence created by the nature of the electricity system itself is the danger of serious power outages due to physical or cyber-attacks on the increasingly fragile transmission and distribution grid.
Regarding oil, which dominates transportation, the high concentration of deposits in the Middle East, especially those that can be most cheaply exploited, makes oil-importing countries hostage both to terrorist attacks on the oil infrastructure and to monopoly-determined prices.
OPEC uses output cuts whenever possible to keep prices at levels that are at least an order of magnitude above the cost of production plus a reasonable return.
As Paul Collier of Oxford University has pointed out, the preponderance of dictatorships and autocratic kingdoms in the ranks of the largest oil exporters indicates that where these huge economic rents exist, pressures are created against economic diversification and democratization.
Most terrorism, ultimately, is oil-funded.
What Collier calls the “Bottom Billion,” the poorest one-sixth of the world, suffers the most from high oil prices.
Heavy national debt and expensive power are problems for relatively wealthy countries, but they are disasters for sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world’s poor.
So what may be the solutions?
First, as the energy campaigner Anne Korin puts it, we need to do to oil what was done to salt just over a century ago.
Salt had been a strategic commodity for millennia – countries fought wars over salt mines – because it was the only way to preserve meat.
But the advent of electricity, refrigeration, and freezing ended salt’s monopoly relatively quickly.
It is still a useful commodity, but no one regards salt mines any more as instruments of national power and influence.
Oil urgently needs to suffer a similar fate.
Oil’s monopoly over transportation can in part be destroyed by electrification (via plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, for example), and also by second-generation biofuels, such as butanol from cellulosic feedstocks, and by algae- and waste-based biofuels.
Studies show clearly that, with time-of-day pricing, electrification of vehicles creates little need for new electricity-generating plants, and also that even with today’s coal-heavy electric grids, electrified vehicles emit less CO2 than gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles.
And, as the grid’s CO2 emissions are cleaned up, the vehicles’ role as a source of emissions will decline.
It is crucial to improve the efficiency of electricity use, especially in lighting, which accounts for a very large share of demand.
LED’s are beginning to lead the way.
Many nations can also learn a great deal from Denmark’s creative use of waste heat for cogeneration.
Solar power is beginning to gain substantially greater prominence, especially for smaller factories and rooftops.
Germany, with its feed-in tariff, has led the way in encouraging such solar deployments, and this approach is beginning to be adopted at the state level in America.
Reductions in the cost of solar power, efficiency improvements, and sharply improved batteries and other means of electricity storage are helping to make possible a world of increasingly distributed energy generation, based on renewable sources.
That, in turn, promises increasing freedom from the dangers created by our vulnerable electric grids and our reliance on oil.
(RO) Madam President, first of all, I, too, need to congratulate Mr Audy for all his efforts on this report.
Our capacity to unite and coordinate our efforts on research determines our economic competitiveness.
I support the idea that better coordination, coherence and synergy between the Seventh Framework Programme and the Structural and Cohesion Funds may also improve the participation of currently under-represented Member States.
Collaborative transnational research must remain a priority.
Member States must cooperate rather than compete with each other.
The success rate, which has been modest so far, can be improved by simplifying administrative and financial regulations.
To conclude in English: earlier this year, Commissioner Quinn stated that 'we need to send red tape to the shredder.
We need simple and clear rules, consistently and rigorously applied'.
Today I ask you, Commissioner, to help us to move from words to action.
Thank you.
. I voted in favour of the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Doyle on ‘Emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles’, for the following reasons:
1. It honours the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere;
2. Environmentally-friendly technologies must be used if we are to prevent climate change and the increasing numbers of natural disasters.
Brussels, 17 November 2005
Alain Rousset (PES-FR), Committee of the Regions rapporteur for the Community Strategic Guidelines for the Cohesion Policy 2007-2013, President of Aquitaine Regional Council and President of the Association of French Regions (ARF), stressed that the "priority" of cohesion policy should be to correct disparities in development at regional and local level.
"Such a drift could pose a strong risk to the continuation of EU cohesion policy,"
In order for funds to concentrate on "genuine regional development priorities", Mr Rousset called for the Community Strategic Guidelines to set clear and focused objectives regarding territorial cohesion, and for "balanced competitiveness" to be the key aim of the guidelines.
He called for the territorial dimension to include a specific paragraph concerning areas with permanent handicaps, the outermost regions, vulnerable rural areas and urban areas in difficulty.
Mr Rousset also stressed the importance of cross-border, transnational cooperation for European integration.
During the debate, Mr Rousset noted the gap that existed "between the document's stated ambitions and the low levels of funding which certain Member States wish to allocate to them under the financial perspectives".

on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, people who live with MS came to us in the Committee on Petitions to alert us to the discrepancies in treatment and opportunities for people with MS across the EU.
Geography should not determine whether your disease goes into remission or progresses.
In my own country of Ireland, we have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients: 17, where we should have a minimum of 39, a fact that negatively affects the outcome for Irish patients.
I would like to correct Mr De Rossa: stem cells obtained from the destruction of embryos have, to date, produced no treatments, whereas stem cells from cord blood have produced over 70 treatments, and it is to be hoped that, some day, there will be a treatment for MS.
Finally, I would like to point out that, in spite of modern medicine and the abundance of food and water, the burden of disease in the EU is increasing.
Why?
Because instances of MS and every other autoimmune condition, of which there are many, are on the increase.
There is a widespread breakdown in the functioning of the human immune system.
This is a crisis that we should not ignore.
It is time to take an honest look at the unnatural and constant way in which modern life bombards the human immune system from its earliest stages, resulting in problems like poor immune development and immune collapse...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, first of all, I should like to make a comment on the process.
I have to say that I am extremely annoyed about finding out that, unknown to Parliament, negotiations are being held with certain Member States or that, in the case of software, Parliament’s view is simply being ignored.
My second comment concerns the content.
There has been much talk about the Lisbon strategy and the need for innovation and promoting the European services market.
I am one of the advocates of the services directive, and it goes without saying that we need clarification and improvement on a number of points, provided this is based on facts and not based on media reports which are full of false information, or with Chirac, Schröder and others.
As for the software, the quality of legislation must not be made subordinate to the power struggle between the institutions.
The innovation that we need must not be stifled by misguided legislation.
In short, Mr McCreevy, I would argue in favour of paying more than lip service to the Lisbon strategy and also of respect for the democratic process and for the elected representatives of Europe’s people.

EIB finances blackburn hospital improvement
Works to improve the quality and efficiency of acute hospital services in Blackburn are being supported with a £50 million (€80.4) loan from the European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term financing institution.
Consort is owned by Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Investments Ltd and by HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited.
Following the project's completion, one of the town's two existing acute hospital sites, Blackburn Royal Infirmary, will close and its services will be relocated to the site of the existing Queens Park Hospital.
EIB Vice-President Peter Sedgwick said: “
Such PPP projects play a key role in the UK government's Private Finance Initiative and are making an important contribution to lowering the cost of such strategic investment to the public sector.
They also introduce private sector efficiencies and expertise into the construction and maintenance of the project.”
Notes to Editors:
The European Investment Bank finances capital investment furthering EU integration, in particular: regional development; trans-European networks in transport, telecoms and energy; industrial competitiveness and integration; small and medium sized enterprises; environmental protection; energy security [?], and health and education projects.
It also operates outside the EU within the framework of the EU's external co-operation policy.
In 2002, the EIB lent some EUR 40 billion, of which EUR 3.3 billion in the UK.
For further particulars on EIB activity, please contact the Bank's Information and Communications Department, Ms Daniela Sacchi, tel. : +352/4379-3130; fax : +352/4379-3188; website : http://www.eib.org
(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, nobody could have failed to notice that Copenhagen was a wasted opportunity.
However - and, yes, I am echoing your words here, Commissioner - this summit still had two virtues.
The first was that it mobilised many more Heads of State or Government than the Kyoto Summit did.
The second is that it enabled emerging countries to benefit from financial commitments aimed specifically at helping them to combat global warming.
So what should Europe do now?
Of course, it should continue its excellent work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, because the truth is that Europe has already been extremely virtuous.
With regard to the Kyoto target, which was an 8% reduction, European companies have achieved a reduction of just under 13%.
The latter have therefore shown themselves to be extremely virtuous and very committed to the protection of the environment.
However, this fight and this virtuous attitude absolutely must not be situated in a context of unfair competition.
As I told you at the hearings, Mr Rehn, all this can be situated only in a context of completely fair competition.
Indeed, we must consider implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union, because we cannot abandon our businesses and thus our jobs to completely unfair competition, to the advantage of countries that show no respect for, or do not apply the same standards regarding, environmental protection and greenhouse gas reduction.
I therefore think it is absolutely essential - and I echo my fellow Member Mrs Lepage here - that, at some time in the future, we give thought to implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union.
Secondly, I was rather delighted to learn at the hearings that Commissioner Tajani has not ruled out the undertaking of an impact study on the possibility of imposing this carbon tax at the borders of the European Union.
Therefore, little by little, I think that we are going to win this battle, because it is important to protect our European companies and jobs.

There is nothing pleasing about the situation in Kosovo or about the role being played by the European Union there.
EULEX, the Union's mission in Kosovo, is, in the case in point, merely the UN's 'military' arm, in charge of overseeing the implementation of a permanent Kosovar government and administration, in breach of UN Resolution 1244, which recognises Serbia's sovereignty over this province.
The good intentions expressed in this House, the advice and the requests have a hard job of hiding a tragic reality: the oppression of the minorities, in particular, the Serb minority, in a territory now given over - because of the international and, in particular, European community - to corruption, organised crime, the Albanian mafia and perhaps even to Islamist terrorist groups.
I am pleased to say that there are 52 amendments which the Commission can support fully, in part, or in principle.
These are amendments 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73 and 75.
The Commission cannot accept amendments 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 35, 42, 46, 53, 54, 63, 64, 65, 71, 72 and 74.

The CoR believes that a long-term vision for transport is essential.
TEN-Ts should therefore not be limited to the territory covered by the current Member States, but envisaged in the context of an enlarged Europe with new neighbourhood relations.
Therefore "an ever-stronger link must be established between trans-European transport networks (TEN-Ts) and the pan-Euro-Mediterranean corridors".
Therefore, the CoR urges the Member States and the Parliament to be more ambitious on various issues:
the CoR agrees with the Commission on the need to increase EU financing for cross-border sections to 30%.
the CoR recognises the importance of the EIB's role but notes that this contribution would not be enough to finance all of the major projects;
the CoR calls for greater synergy of TEN-Ts with the Structural Funds but warns against using the cohesion funds to finance TEN-Ts;
Lastly, the CoR stresses the importance of the role of local and regional authorities in the major EU task of linking territories through TEN-Ts.
The CoR considers it essential that the local and regional authorities affected be involved in setting up steering committees for the priority routes and in the procedures for assessing and drawing up projects.
Brussels, 6th May 2003
Operating costs would therefore decrease.
In principle prices should come down for them because there would be no more hidden VAT.
Why would the abolition of the VAT exemption be an advantage for the postal services suppliers that are currently exempt?
This non-reclaimable VAT will be an extra cost to the operator.
As a result it has higher costs.
Where purchases are used for both purposes this can lead to complex calculations.
Why is it an advantage to customers if all businesses can reclaim their VAT under this proposal?
Because it is not possible to define exactly any business sector.
The postal services sector is part of the wider transport sector.
The VAT system is designed to apply broadly to all economic transactions and exemptions have to be very narrowly defined for the system to work effectively.
What would be the level of the optional reduced rate of VAT?
Reduced rates in Member States currently vary between 5% and 17%.
Because a reduced rate across the whole sector would mean a significant revenue loss for Member States, which would inevitably have to be recouped elsewhere.
The sector includes national and international transport and is very large.
Is the Commission proposal a new idea?
No.
The Commission set out its plans with regard to VAT and postal services in its Strategy To Improve The Operation Of The VAT System (see IP/00/615), published in June 2000.
This strategy includes various measures to modernise, simplify and improve the operation of the current VAT system, including postal services, and improve the functioning of the Internal Market by removing competitive distortions.
This fisheries protocol ensures fishing opportunities in the Seychelles' exclusive economic zone for various fleets from the Member States.
These include five Portuguese surface long-liners.
The renewal of this protocol aims to support the sustainability of long-distance fishing fleets from the Member States, a section of the fleets that has been particularly affected by the crisis in the fisheries sector in recent years.
This is a goal and a concern that we naturally share.
However, we cannot fail to point out some doubts that remain - arising from other fisheries partnership agreements - about the effectiveness of the stated objectives of cooperation on sustainable development in the sector for the third country in question, and on the sustainability and monitoring of their fishing activities.
These are issues that it is important to clarify in the future.
We note the fact that fishing opportunities have been reduced by half and that the cost of licences has been increased to EUR 40 000 for tuna seiners, although there has been an increase in the number of these ships covered by the agreement.
Brussels, 10 January 2012 - On the eve of the second anniversary of the earthquake that struck Haiti, the European Commission launches today in Port-au-Prince a new housing programme to repair and rebuild safe homes to the benefit of more than 60 000 displaced people.
It is a part the part of the European Commission's action to support the country to recover from the disaster which claimed the lives of more than 220,000 people and affected 3 million others.
The two years that followed the earthquake were no less challenging – Haiti was affected by Hurricane Tomas and is suffering from the worst cholera epidemics of the past century.
The years ahead will not be easy either, but the long-term goals of stability and development are still fully valid to address Haiti's situation.
The European Union has been among the first, the most generous and the most efficient donors of aid and civil protection support to Haiti in the past two years.
Its assistance aims both to bring immediate relief to Haitians and to ensure long-term recovery of their country.
To date, Europeans' solidarity has alleviated the suffering of 5 million people in Haiti, has prevented the crisis from deteriorating further and has limited the disaster's twin side-effects: cholera and malnutrition.
Looking back to the challenges of bringing relief to Haiti and supporting its recovery during that past two years, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, Catherine Ashton, stated: "
On this second anniversary of the 2010 earthquake, I would like to praise the bravery and determination of the Haitian people in getting their country back on its feet.
I am pleased that the most acute humanitarian problems have been tackled, but I am fully aware that difficult reconstruction challenges remain.
We will continue to work with our Haitian friends, with EU Member States and our international partners to improve infrastructure, assist the economic recovery, and support improved governance and the consolidation of Haitian democracy and State institutions."
EU Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgssaid: "
Two years after the terrible earthquake, the reconstruction of Haiti is and will remain a priority in our agenda.
When I met Prime Minister Conille during the European Development Days few weeks ago, I was pleased to see that we share a common ambition for the future of the country.
Rebuilding the roads, homes, public buildings, schools for the hundreds of thousands of families who were left homeless, may seem like a Herculean task but ambitious projects are already making a difference on the ground; providing better access to education, more secure livelihoods; improving the quality of the roads and stimulating local economy."
He added: "
I will visit Haiti later this year, notably to inaugurate a training centre and the rehabilitation of the main road.
We will also carry on providing active support to the State's efforts to maintain social, health and education services for the people of Haiti and put the country on the road of economic development"
The European Commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis response – Kristalina Georgieva, said: "
Haiti's earthquake caused tremendous suffering - but it also triggered an unmatched support from all over the world.
Europe was there on Day One.
Less than 24 hours after the earthquake struck, the Commission deployed humanitarian and civil protection experts and mobilised emergency assistance.
And we will remain there as long as there are people who need our help.
Today still half a million Haitians live in camps and cholera persists.
More importantly, we recognise that Haiti will remain vulnerable to natural disasters, like hurricanes, floods and landslides, and are committed to help the communities we work with to boost their disaster resilience."
Background
During the last two years, the EU has been providing both humanitarian assistance and development aid to rebuild Haiti.

rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I should like to begin by turning my thoughts respectfully to our late fellow Member, Mr Correia, who contributed substantially to the compilation of the correct and comprehensive report cited by the Vice-President of the Commission.
I should like to point out that the topic we are discussing today has a very long history.
It began in 1983with a Council of Europe convention, which was accepted by all the Member States.
However, the convention stipulated that a prisoner could be transferred from one country to another only with the prisoner's consent.
The convention was therefore ineffective.
A second convention was drawn up stipulating that the consent of the prisoner was not required, but this convention was not signed by all the Member States of the Council of Europe, and thus the attempt foundered.
On the new initiative of three EU Member States - Austria, Finland and Sweden - a draft was submitted, which was properly prepared by the Council and issued as a framework convention.
What does this framework decision provide?
It provides that a sentenced citizen of an EU Member State must be transferred to the Member State of which he is a national or in which he has his permanent residence or all his interests.
This is very reasonable because we can see that rehabilitating him will become much easier when he comes out of prison: someone transferred to the Member State of their nationality will have much easier access to the language, and their friends and relatives, and will be in a familiar environment.
This report, as you will recall, Madam President, was approved in June 2006 by a large majority in Parliament.
Unfortunately, it met with a bureaucratic response from Poland, which, by various procedural ploys, delayed the implementation of this framework decision.
We thus find ourselves in the midst of renewed deliberation.
Fortunately, with a concession to Poland's demands, the problem has finally been solved satisfactorily.
However, let me point out, Madam President, that if we think like this, talk of a united Europe is impossible.
We cannot speak of a European consensus when each Member State, for its own petty reasons, undermines such a sound measure.
In such cases, what sort of united Europe are we talking about?
I should like to underline that the Constitutional Treaty presented two days ago by the Prime Minister of Portugal fortunately provides for an augmented majority in this area, too, so the veto will finally be lifted.
To conclude, let me thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, for his contribution, and express the wish that, after 25 years, this well-conceived initiative will finally become a reality as soon as possible.
7. European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (
– Mr President, a simple ban on nickel-cadmium accumulators seems appealing to me at first glance, but a more in-depth analysis prompts me to recommend real derogations in terms of the industrial use of these accumulators.
In particular, these accumulators are used in the security and transport sectors – in aeroplanes and trains, for example.
These accumulators are much sought-after for their operational reliability in critical conditions, which makes it difficult to introduce alternative products.
The rules are already very strict.
The risks connected to the end of life of this type of accumulator are controlled, not least by means of the producers taking responsibility for the collection and recycling of their accumulators.
Ladies and gentlemen, I draw your attention to the definitions adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which give precedence to the physical characteristics of the battery over the way in which it is used.
Certain batteries would therefore, in all likelihood, become de facto casualties of the ban, such as those used in breathing apparatus systems employed in toxic atmospheres, lamps for individual or collective use in the mining sector, and so on.
Public service has a vital role to play in a democratic society – to be an arena for scrutiny, to enable different voices to be heard and different opinions to be voiced, to provide impartial and in-depth information.
The market has no such role nor can it fully meet the need for programmes targeting minority groups in society.
Public service is the driving force behind developments in the media.
The media works increasingly with new technologies. However, the new media landscape in the knowledge and information society does not reduce the need for public service – on the contrary.
In the light of technological developments in the media and the greater need for an independently financed media sector, how will the Commission ensure that public service in the European Union can maintain its position when new media technologies are being used to an ever greater extent?
The Commission's proposals for improved economic governance are of major importance for the future of the European Union and for growth in the countries belonging to the euro area.
Economic governance should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust EU national economic policy surveillance framework.
If the latter is to be credible and efficient, it must be strengthened by the introduction of yearly fines for non-compliance with recommendations or the obligation to draw up a sufficient corrective action plan.
We believe that economic governance and national economic policy should be a matter of common concern for all the parties involved, and that there should be an emphasis on early detection and prevention of potentially harmful macroeconomic imbalances.
Greater involvement of parliaments at national level and EU level alike is therefore needed.
Lastly, we believe that the Commission should have a stronger and more independent role in the surveillance procedure as regards assessments that are specific to each Member State, monitoring, missions, recommendations, warnings and sanctions.
We also believe that enhanced transparency and accountability are crucial, in order to strengthen peer support and peer pressure, and that Parliament should have a stronger role in the surveillance process, but not an executive role.
.
Mr President, since mutual trust between the United States and the European Union has come under pressure in recent years, I should like to single out two things that need to be resolved in order for that trust to be rebuilt.
We should not resign ourselves to the visa requirements which the United States imposes on some EU citizens.
Commission President Barroso was right to urge the United States to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the ten new Member States.
It is unfair, on principle, to use double standards such as these for EU citizens.
In the coming weeks, the temporary committee of inquiry into alleged CIA camps will be discussing its draft interim report.
There are indications that irregularities have occurred in the treatment of suspects, but so far, there is no hard evidence of this.
This temporary committee will continue its activities in order to deliver convincing evidence, if possible.
In that light, Parliament will, in the run-up to the Summit, need to insist on substantial cooperation.
I should like to ask your support for paragraph 11 from the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which has been tabled as Amendment 34.
in writing. - The EU is all about free movement of people, goods, services and capital.
Obstacles for these are to be taken seriously.
The fight against terrorism as part of international crime must not be neglected.
Terrorism is, however, a delicate topic.
We must not ever forget that all policies on counter-terrorism have to be based on respect for fundamental rights and human dignity.
Measures also need to be effective and proportionate to the gain of security.
I doubt, for example, that the new restrictions on liquids on aeroplanes meet these criteria.
All in all, every effort towards better coordination between Member States, and between them and the EU institutions, should be welcomed.
After Mr de Vries stepped down, a new EU anti-terrorism coordinator should be appointed as soon as possible.
Brussels, 30 May 2006
Three new initiatives for cohesion policy launched in Brussels by Regional policy Commissioner Danuta Hübner and international financial institutions
In the presence of Commission President José Manuel Barroso, Regional policy Commissioner Danuta Hübner, European Investment Bank (EIB) President Philippe Maystadt and the heads of other international financial institutions signed today in Brussels three new cohesion policy joint initiatives to deliver more investment, growth and jobs to the regions.
The launching took the form of the signing of three memoranda of understanding between the institutions involved.
In particular, JASPERS was signed also by European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) President Jean Lemierre, JEREMIE by European Investment Fund (EIF) Chief Executive Francis Carpenter, and JESSICA by Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) Governor Raphael Alomar.
The three memoranda present the way the joint approach and work of the partners will be organised regarding each of the three - initiatives.
In legal terms, the initiatives are foreseen by the new regulations for the Structural Funds which are now in the process of final adoption by the Council and the Parliament.
Commissioner Hübner said: "
JASPERS, JEREMIE and JESSICA are already well known and have created new dynamics and expectations for investment, growth and jobs in the Member States and regions, as well among the social partners across all the regions of the European Union".
This enhanced involvement of the international financial institutions and the European financial sector will contribute additional financial and technical expertise, energy and human resources for more and better projects, more and better investments in undertakings, as well in public private partnerships and projects for sustainable urban development.
Furthermore, it will leverage additional loan capital from the international financial institutions, as well as private capital from European banks and investors, to complement scarce public resources, European and national, for more investments, growth and jobs.
Background
JASPERS (Joint Assistance in Supporting Projects in European Regions) is a partnership between the Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
It aims to improve the preparation of major projects to be co-financed by the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), in particular in the new Member States, during the next period 2007-2013.
It foresees using the technical and financial expertise of the banks to strengthen the capacity of national and regional authorities, helping them to deliver high-quality project proposals which will make efficient use of EU funds and mobilise additional sources of funding.
JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) is a joint initiative of the Commission and the European Investment Fund with the European Investment Bank.
It aims to improve access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and in particular the supply of micro credit, venture capital, loan or guarantees and other forms of innovative financing.
It is aimed especially at micro to medium-sized enterprises.
JEREMIE means that SMEs in all regions will be able to benefit from tailored financial engineering products.
It is a direct response to the challenge of continuous economic adjustment, and in this context the JEREMIE Memorandum of Understanding organises the joint approach between the Commission and the EIF in this respect.
JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) is a joint initiative of the Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.
The parties involved, already experienced in the field of lending for urban development and renewal, as well for social housing, have agreed in the context of the Urban/JESSICA memorandum, to work closely with the Commission in the framework of the new ERDF programmes, where they have an urban development component.
The aim is to combine the grants under the programmes for urban development and renewal, or social housing where appropriate, with the loans and the expertise of the Banks for urban development and renewal, including social housing.
The Banks have also committed themselves to a more streamlined approach to lending in this field of urban development, making it more user-friendly for end-users.
Commissioner Piebalgs announces EU support for building the largest solar power plant in West Africa, ahead of energy ministerial meeting in Addis Ababa
Today, EU Development Commissioner Piebalgs announced that the EU will support the construction of what will be the largest African photovoltaic power plant, in Burkina Faso.
It will provide 32 gigawatt hours per year, the equivalent of 6% of the country's current electricity production.
This will cover the energy consumption of around 400,000 people.
Commissioner Piebalgs made the announcement before departing to Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) where he will attend the Conference of African Energy Ministers and All Africa Energy Week.
Commissioner Piebalgs said: "
More than 1 billion people on the planet do not have access to electricity, half of them in Africa.
This is one of the greatest brakes on Africa's development.
To unlock this huge potential the EU pledged to connect 500 million people to energy and we put our money where our mouth is.
The new solar power plant in Burkina Faso shows that the EU is committed to supporting a much-needed change in Africa's production of sustainable energy.
For Burkina Faso, this means massively improved supply of greener electricity, increased energy independence of the country, and a more secure energy supply for the population".
Located in Zagtouli, on the outskirts of the capital Ouagadougou, the new power plant will comprise 96,000 solar panels.
Currently, only 15% of the Burkinabe population have access to electricity and the country still heavily depends on energy imports.
The strong reliance on fossil fuels has a negative impact on the environment.
He will also have various bilateral meetings with African Ministers for Energy.
EU cooperation on sustainable energy for all
The EU is the biggest donor in energy worldwide.
The EU is engaged, with its partners in the UN-led Sustainable Energy for All Initiative; President José Manuel Barroso pledged that the Commission will assist developing countries in providing energy access for 500 million people by 2030.
The financial instruments may cover, for example, support to public-private partnerships on energy access or the development of new business models for sustainable energy investments in rural or off-grid areas.

Mr President, I am delighted that this debate has taken the form it has.
I think that shows that in this debate at least, sweeteners can be a '' as well!
The rapporteur has steered this debate impeccably through the difficulties that we often encounter with these comparatively small arguments.
The problem very often is that they turn into the legislative equivalent of a Venus Flytrap.
You hover around them and suddenly you are sucked in and find enormous difficulties.
I believe that the three amendments the Commission has accepted are the right ones.
I think it is completely satisfactory for us that we have a period of review, that we have avoided the problems that we suspected in comitology and that, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has said, we have been able to support and not needlessly challenge the opinion of the scientific committees.
That is why I think Mr Lannoye's amendment was an amendment too far in that direction.
It is not our job always to say, after there has been scientific appraisal, that is not good enough, and there should be further appraisal immediately.
If you do that you devalue the work of the scientific committees, introduce an atmosphere of suspicion and end up with an unsatisfactory proposal.
So I am delighted that we have moved in this direction.
I am delighted also that we have reduced the level of cyclamates that can be used because of all our concerns about the exploitation of children and the way they now consume a variety of sweetened products.
Finally I should say to the Commission in particular that if we could, in all circumstances, treat these small but important debates seriously but without the kind of hysteria that we sometimes get on either side, this Parliament would be a happier and a wiser place.
(PL) Mr President, even if it is true that some of the private media in Kenya helped to instigate riots following the emotional election campaign, this is no justification for restricting the freedom of speech.
The attack on the freedom of the press in Kenya also involved the violation of the fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy.
It is worth stressing that the new legislation was adopted by 25 out of the 220 members of parliament.
This is an utterly inconceivable situation.
What is worse is that, until that point, Kenya had boasted one of the most developed and pluralistic press networks in the whole of Africa.
This will change after the new legislation is implemented, which will allow special services to interfere in the activities of the media, close down editorial sections and control the printed or spoken word.
Restricting the freedom of the media sector in the name of national security can only have the opposite effect to the one intended.
Reinventing Energy
NEW YORK ­– The world economy is being battered by sharply higher energy prices.
While a few energy-exporting countries in the Middle East and elsewhere reap huge profits, the rest of the world is suffering as the price of oil has topped $110 per barrel and that of coal has doubled.
Without plentiful and low-cost energy, every aspect of the global economy is threatened.
For example, food prices are increasing alongside soaring oil prices, partly because of increased production costs, but also because farmland in the United States and elsewhere is being converted from food production to bio-fuel production.
No quick fix exists for oil prices.
Higher prices reflect basic conditions of supply and demand. The world economy – especially China, India, and elsewhere in Asia – has been growing rapidly, leading to a steep increase in global demand for energy, notably for electricity and transport.
Yet global supplies of oil, natural gas, and coal cannot easily keep up, even with new discoveries.
And, in many places, oil supplies are declining as old oil fields are depleted.
Coal is in somewhat larger supply, and can be turned into liquid fuels for transport.
Yet coal is an inadequate substitute, partly because of limited supplies, and partly because coal emits large amounts of carbon dioxide per unit of energy, and therefore is a dangerous source of man-made climate change.
For developing countries to continue to enjoy rapid economic growth, and for rich countries to avoid a slump caused, it will be necessary to develop new energy technologies.
Three objectives should be targeted: low-cost alternatives to fossil fuels, greater energy efficiency, and reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions.
The most promising technology in the long term is solar power.
The total solar radiation hitting the planet is about 1,000 times the world’s commercial energy use.
This means that even a small part of the earth’s land surface, notably in desert regions, which receive massive solar radiation, can supply large amounts of the electricity for much of the rest of the world.
For example, solar power plants in America’s Mohave Desert could supply more than half of the country’s electricity needs.
Solar power plants in Northern Africa could supply power to Western Europe. And solar power plants in the Sahel of Africa, just south of the vast Sahara, could supply power to much of West, East, and Central Africa.
Perhaps the single most promising development in terms of energy efficiency is “plug-in hybrid technology” for automobiles, which may be able to triple the fuel efficiency of new automobiles within the next decade.
The idea is that automobiles would run mainly on batteries recharged each night on the electricity grid, with a gasoline-hybrid engine as a backup to the battery.
General Motors might have an early version by 2010.
The most important technology for the safe environmental use of coal is the capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants.
Such “carbon capture and sequestration,” or CCS, is urgently needed in the major coal-consuming countries, especially China, India, Australia, and the US.
The key CCS technologies have already been developed; it is time to move from engineering blueprints to real demonstration power plants.
For all of these promising technologies, governments should be investing in the science and high costs of early-stage testing.
Without at least partial public financing, the uptake of these new technologies will be slow and uneven.
Indeed, most major technologies that we now take for granted – airplanes, computers, the Internet, and new medicines, to name but a few – received crucial public financing in the early stages of development and deployment.
It is shocking, and worrisome, that public financing remains slight, because these technologies’ success could translate into literally trillions of dollars of economic output.
For example, according to the most recent data from the International Energy Agency, in 2006 the US government invested a meager $3 billion per year in energy research and development.
In inflation-adjusted dollars, this represented a decline of roughly 40% since the early 1980’s, and now equals what the US spends on its military in just 1.5 days.
The situation is even more discouraging when we look at the particulars.
US government funding for renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, geothermal, ocean, and bio-energy) totaled a meager $239 million, or just three hours of defense spending.
Spending on carbon capture and sequestration was just $67 million, while spending for energy efficiency of all types (buildings, transport, and industry) was $352 million.
Of course, developing new energy technologies is not America’s responsibility alone.
Global cooperation on energy technologies is needed both to increase supplies and to ensure that energy use is environmentally safe, especially to head off man-made climate change from the use of fossil fuels.
This would not only be good economics, but also good politics, since it could unite the world in our common interest, rather than dividing the world in a bitter struggle over diminishing oil, gas, and coal reserves.
in writing. - (FR) AIDS is back with a vengeance.
Record levels have been reached in Belgium, with 1 072 new infections in 2005: an increase of 52% in eight years.
Fewer people die of the disease, at least in Belgium.
AIDS has become commonplace, however.
Using condoms is like having to follow a diet all year round; sometimes, you want to give in.
We must therefore strengthen the resources for prevention and, in areas strongly influenced by religion, point out that calls for abstinence are out of the question.
It was for this reason that I co-signed the draft resolution on AIDS.
I wanted to draw attention to the children who are victims of AIDS.
There are 15 million children orphaned due to the disease, of which 12 million are in Africa alone.
Professor Montagnier, who discovered the virus, said that it would take ten years for the full impact of the wave of infection to be seen and that the demographic impact would be considerable, because the disease would wipe out an entire population of young adults.
This Friday is the International Day of Action on HIV and AIDS.
We cannot miss this opportunity to point out the growing magnitude of AIDS.
Thankfully, the death rate due to other infectious diseases should, meanwhile, decrease.
PANORAMA OF EC INDUSTRY 1990 THE END OF THE 1980s: INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY AND RESTORED CONFIDENCE EC industry has made important progress over the last decade.
Productivity and profitability have recovered steadily and investment has risen by nearly 30%.
Throughout the 1980s industrial production increased by 20% and as the employment content of growth increased, several millions of new jobs were created.
Substantial structural changes have taken place.
Since 1980, some industries achieved productivity increases of 30% and more (steel, chemicals, aerospace).
The share of industry in the EC's final energy consumption has fallen from 35% in 1973 to 28% in 1988.
From 1987 to 1990, healthy prospects, improved finances and high utilisation rates have caused the growth of investment to continue and to become the strongest source of GDP growth in the Community.
However, only in 1988 the pace of industrial production growth at 4.3% was almost back at the level it reached in 1979.
The favourable trend was confirmed in 1989 with a 4% growth rate.
Railway material manufacture, ore production, agricultural machinery and shipbuilding and repair performed worst in that period.
From 1985 to 1988 they saw their output shrinking by more than 2% annually.
A major difference between US and Japanese direct investment in the EC is the share that manufacturing takes in it: in 1988, 63% of cumulated US investment was in manufacturing compared to 16% of Japanese investment.
When the book went to the press the impact of the changes in Eastern Europe could not be fully appreciated yet.
But it also reflects the trend toward the externalization of services.
Cleaning services - or industrial cleaning - forms a striking example.
It has presently 1.5 million people employed throughout the EC.
In Belgium and France, in 1970, 25% of the total market for cleaning services was provided for by specialized cleaning firms compared with 40% in 1988.
EC INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD MARKET The expansion of trade accompanied and in large part conditioned the revival of EC industry.
Expectations concerning the internal market and the accession of Spain and Portugal made intra-Community trade expand faster than world trade.
The intra-EC share of Community exports rose to more than 62% in 1988 from 55% in 1982 compared with a downward trend at the beginning of the decade and a constant share of 61% from 1973 to 1979.
Intra-Community trade expansion was greatly fuelled by trade in high-tech products which saw an increase as high as 20% in 1988.
However, it appears that a shift to "clean technologies" could reconcile requirements of competitiveness and efficiency with minimal environmental damage and minimal inputs of scarce resources.
The promotion of "clean products" may cause shifts in demand as traditional products are progressively substituted.
This is witnessed, for instance, by the rapid expansion of the market for environmentally friendly aerosols.
Industries that will benefit from currently increasing environmental concerns are clean vehicles, chemicals, sophisticated control systems and process technologies.
An industry that is, obviously, bound to expand rapidly is the environmental protection industry.
Particularly in Germany, there is already a big market for its products, larger than that market in the UK and France combined.
The sector is becoming increasingly internationalized.
Exports account for over 40% of sales of Germany's environmental industry.
The leader in the US market for water supply is a French based company and the number four in the US market for waste collection and treatment is UK based.
The creation of the Single Market is likely to further enhance the growth of this industry through harmonization of standards and liberalisation of public procurement.
DEVELOPMENT AND OUTLOOK BY SECTOR The mining industry, after a long period of decline and restructuring, has now largely increased its productivity and expects to be profitable again.
In 1988 the production and consumption of steel in the industrial world reached record levels.
EC production saw a 10% increase over the 1987 level to increase another 1% in 1989.
Most of them are confident about the medium term future.
There is some concern that an excess of capacity growth could disturb prospects again.
Business in the construction materials sector largely followed events in the construction sector.
The industry which had an output of 45 billion ecus and employed 500 000 people, expects further modest growth for the next few years.
The turnover of the EC chemical sector represents 28% of world turnover of the sector.
At least 9 000 chemical companies operate in the EC.
Of the world's ten largest chemical companies seven are EC companies and of the top thirty 17 are.
In 1988 and 1989, the sector saw a robust 6% growth which is expected to continue at a more modest level in 1990.
Utilisation rates are close to their maximum.
In 1988 total employment increased again for the first time since the seventies.
Production in the electrical and electronic engineering industry began to pick up again as early as 1983 and its employment in 1985.
In 1988 and 1989 the sector saw its production grow by about 3% and the same figure is expected for 1990.
The industry is possibly facing the biggest challenge in its history.
Companies will continue restructuring and seek various forms of co-operation.
Employment in the shipbuilding industry has practically halved since 1980.
The EC's share of a strongly reduced world production went down from 27% in 1976 to only 19% in 1988.
As demand has recently increased again, the prospects for the industry are better than they have been for many years provided that capacity cutbacks in Japan and Korea follow the European pattern and that competitor countries follow a market oriented investment policy.
The EC aeronautics industry is a success story in its own right.
Throughout the 1980s production rose by an annual 5%.
Although long-term prospects are favourable, the industry considers its short-term outlook as unpromising.
Instrument engineering, with an employment figure of over 300 000, saw steady growth throughout the decade and is likely to further increase its production by at least 5% per year.
Unilever and Nestlé are the number one and two on the list of the world's biggest food producers.
But the trend towards global consolidation is dominated by US companies which occupy the third to the tenth place.
The high level of mergers and acquisitions is largely to be explained by the need that is felt to expand market shares in a slowly growing market.
The textiles, leather and clothing industry accounts for 7% of the EC's manufacturing production.
In the last decade the industry has been confronted with strong international competition and rising imports.
This, together with the necessary restructuring process, led to the loss of 600 000 jobs since 1980.
The sector is considered to have good prospects as growth rates of 5% and more are seen as possible.
Pulp, paper, printing and publishing, with 1.3 people employed, accounts for almost 6% of EC manufacture production.
Since 1982, its production has experienced relatively high growth rates, both in value and in volume.
The outlook is fair with an expected 3% real growth per year.
Rubber and plastics processing with about one million employment has been showing an average annual real growth of 3.2% since 1980.
Employment declined until 1983 when strong demand for plastics, particularly in new areas of application, caused a sharp rise in total employment, even though employment in the rubber industry continued to decline until its stabilization starting in 1987.
Given the constant appearance of new applications for plastics, an annual growth rate of more than 4% is expected in the next few years while rubber will probably grow at a more moderate pace of about 2.5% per year.
Its activity picked up again in 1986 after a steady decline from 1980 up to 1985.
Traditional wholesale services are still in strong demand, but increasingly they are supplied as part of a sophisticated package of services including marketing know-how, financial services and consultancy.
Incomplete figures suggest that over the last ten years economic activity in the distributive trades as a whole has grown at a rate broadly comparable with that of the economy as a whole.
This growth is, however, taking place against a background of rapid change, involving the disappearance of many traditional businesses and the emergence of new enterprises of a markedly different character.
It is difficult to determine the overall rate of growth in this industry over the last decade.
Deregulation and increased competition will lead to higher capacity utilisation rates and lower prices.
Directives to reduce the level of protection in the transport sector coupled with the higher demand for transport brought about by the internal market should produce them.
Prospects are good and the Single Market will offer new opportunities for merchandise and passenger transport alike.
Although data on production and employment of the business services sector is limited, conservative estimates suggest that its employment amounts to 5.4 million.
This agreement gives reciprocal access to short-stay, visa-free travel for all EU and Brazilian citizens holding a diplomatic, service or official passport.
To ensure equal treatment of all EU citizens as regards visa-free travel, Article 8 of the agreement provides that Brazil can suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all Member States of the Union and, reciprocally, the EU may suspend or terminate the agreement only with respect to all Member States.
The agreement provides for the establishment of a committee of experts to settle disputes that may arise from the interpretation or application of its provisions.
The agreement also provides for the exchange of passport specimens between Brazil and the Member States.
I believe that the safeguarding of existing bilateral agreements should remain of the utmost importance for the European Union as these are providing a short-stay visa waiver for categories of travellers not covered by the EU-Brazil agreement.
In this regard, it should be recalled that the European Union might apply the suspension clause of the EU-Brazil visa waiver if Brazil were to denounce the bilateral agreements.
This visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports represents a step forward in the establishment of full reciprocal visa exemption in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 539/2001.

(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Manders on his work on this report, as well as thank the other fellow Members who worked with him on it.
In truth, it is only because this proposal simplifies and improves the legislative framework that is in force by bringing together all the existing legislation - three basic directives on naming and labelling textile products - that it is important.
However, in addition to that, this proposal will have a positive impact on private actors and on the public authorities, and will also allow newly developed fibres to be developed, so encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector.
This revision will also make the process of adding new fibres to the list of harmonised fibre names more transparent.
There no longer seem to be any doubts that this regulation will be to the advantage of the actors involved.
Consider the textile industry, which will benefit from reduced administrative costs and the possibility of bringing new fibres to the marketplace earlier.
For their part, the authorities in the Member States will not need to transpose the alterations to national legislation, which will enable them to significantly reduce their costs.
Moreover, consumers will receive a guarantee that named fibres meet specific characteristics, and will also benefit from the fact that new fibres will reach the market earlier.
The introduction of these fibres is important for European industry as a way of promoting innovation, which will mean that more information will reach consumers.
In the current context of a globalised world and emerging economies with ever-larger markets in which millions of products produced by millions of companies are in circulation, a commitment to innovation and the speed with which this innovation reaches consumers is absolutely crucial for companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The application of this regulation could see an increase in the competitiveness of SMEs.
This new regulation will definitely mean that these SMEs increase their market share and it will, in this way, contribute to employment in Europe.

A new stage in the European strategy for the outermost regions
Danuta Hübner, Commissioner for regional policy, is today presenting the communication "The outermost regions: an asset for Europe", which proposes a renewed strategy for the seven regions: the four French overseas departments, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion and Martinique, the Portuguese autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira and the Spanish Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.
The Commissioner is calling for the outermost regions (OR) to be considered as "regions of opportunity", rich in potential for the development of the Union as a whole.
This change in approach could come about through the optimal use of all of the existing Community instruments, greater knowledge about the OR and strengthened partnership.
This new communication is a response to the expectations of the main players in these regions, expressed during the debate we initiated last year.
The OR have much to offer the European Union.
They are located in areas of geostrategic significance for the European Union’s maritime dimension and neighbourhood policy.
The Commission therefore proposes:
- to address the new challenges linked to climate change, demographic trends and migratory flows.
This will entail:
encouraging the implementation of an integrated policy for the management of risks coastal areas (flooding, coastline erosion, vulnerability of people and property)
reinforcing regional integration (for instance, setting up short-distance maritime links)
providing start-up and investment assistance for young farmers
- Strengthening the partnership between the European Union, the OR and their associated Member States.
Commissioner Hübner proposes in particular that a “Forum for outermost Europe” be organised every two years in order to improve dialogue and raise awareness of the specific characteristics of the OR.
Background
With this communication, the Commission is responding to the public consultation and following up the call made by the European Council of December 2007.
Numerous projects supported by the European Union bear witness to the capacity of the OR to specialise in cutting-edge sectors and implement pilot projects that can benefit the Union as a whole.

Madam President, unlike the last discussion, which was virtually unanimous in its approach, this is the exact opposite.
Many people are very concerned about this proposed free trade agreement.
Now free trade agreements, bilateral agreements, are the norm at this point in time and I think we have much more in common with Canada than any differences.
They are a democracy.
They respect human rights.
They speak mainly English and French, European languages, and they are open to take in many people, even from my own country, who cannot find jobs in Ireland.
There are issues, largely concerning seals and tar sands.
Obviously, they are important but, at the end of the day, I think that some of the points made here would be refuted by the Canadians - because I am a member of the EU-Canadian delegation and these matters have been discussed and they would have a different perspective - and that is why it is important that we continue to negotiate with them on these issues.
But the bottom line is - and nobody referred to it other than the Commissioner - that there is a EUR 20 billion benefit to both economies here if we can work out a free trade agreement.
It is worth trying.
(GA) Thank you, Madam President.
Fisheries: Commission proposes fishing opportunities for 2013 in the Atlantic and North Sea
The European Commission has proposed fishing opportunities for 2013 for certain fish stocks in the Atlantic and the North Sea.
Today's proposal sets levels of total allowable catch (TAC) and fishing effort for stocks managed exclusively by the EU.
In line with scientific advice, the Commission proposes to increase or maintain the TACs for 16 stocks (including certain stocks of cod, Norway lobster, and sole), and reduce them for 47 stocks.
The Commission's ultimate goal and one of the pillars of the on-going Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform is to have all stocks fished at sustainable levels, the so-called Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), by 2015.
Whenever possible, scientists advise on how to bring the stocks to MSY levels.
This year, the so-called "MSY advice" could be issued for 20 stocks (compared to 12 last year).
This is a marked improvement as far as the availability and quality of scientific data are concerned.
European fishermen face a bleak future without sustainable, healthy stocks.
Thanks to long-term management a number of stocks in the Atlantic waters are already fished at MSY levels.
But at the same time 47% of stocks are still overfished.
These facts support the Commission's vision for the CFP reform ."
Details of the proposals
According to scientific advice, Norway lobster in the West of Scotland, plaice in the Eastern Channel, cod and sole in the Celtic Sea, and sole in the Western Channel are at MSY levels and the Commission proposes to raise or maintain their TACs.
At the same time, cod stocks in the Irish Sea and the Kattegat continue to be in a poor state, and the poor data hampers the management of these stocks.
Sole in the Irish Sea is at extremely low levels and the Commission proposes to stop the direct fisheries and minimise the by-catches.
MSY advice for haddock in the Celtic Sea and sole in the Bay of Biscay demands considerable TACs cuts, so that the stocks can be brought to MSY levels.
Cod and whiting in the West of Scotland, subject to extremely high rates of discarding, continue to be in a very poor state and well below safe levels.
For more than 30 stocks where data is limited, the Commission has followed the direction recommended by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), and proposed cutting the TAC by 20%, in light of recent trends observed in these stocks, and on precautionary considerations.
For 13 stocks the scientific advice has been recently received, and needs to be further analysed before the proposal can be updated, later in the autumn.
Background
The present proposal concerns only the 83 stocks for which the TACs are decided by the EU alone.
A second proposal will deal with the stocks for which the fishing opportunities are set in the context of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) or consultations with third countries (shared stocks).
It will be tabled later this autumn when some of the results of those international negotiations become available.
The proposed catch limits are based on the scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).
Stakeholders were also consulted, based on the Commission's Consultation document from June (IP/12/584 ).

Madam President, the Joxer character created by the great Irish playwright, Sean O'Casey, observed the whole world as 'in a state of chassis'.
And certainly the evidence is there for all to see.
If we look downwards, we see oil gushing from an oil well, decimating the environment; if we look upwards, we will see volcanic ash gushing from a volcano decimating the airlines, and if we look outwards, we see recession gushing from the banks decimating the economy.
Certainly I have suffered, like many more, from the volcanic ash, the first time going home: it took me two days; I had to hitchhike part of the way.
The second time I could not get out to the last plenary; it took me one and a half days to go to Brussels and one and a half days to come here, but the one thing I have learned is that it is impossible to book a ticket on the Eurostar when you are travelling.
You need your credit card to book it and you need it to get the ticket, which is impossible when you are in transit.
I would ask the Commission to use their influence to try and get them to have the same system as that which applies to ferries and airlines.
.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx, the Chairman of the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea, Mr Jarzembowski, and the whole committee for the magnificent work that they have done to increase maritime safety.
I am convinced that this work and the report being presented today will make a valuable contribution towards continuing to improve safety at sea in Europe and doing as much as possible to prevent further environmental catastrophes.
I would like to say that now that we are reaching the end of the legislature, we can be proud that, among other things, it has been the legislature of safety at sea.
There have been other terrible incidents like the or the in the past, but the appropriate steps were simply not taken, practically no measures were adopted to prevent, alleviate or correct them or to safeguard against them happening again.
In this case that was not what happened.
In this case we have adopted measures and the Member States are acting, albeit not always in a satisfactory manner.
As I stated in my speech to the MARE Committee on 22 January 2004 as a result of the entry into force of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system on 5 February, the Commission has already begun the appropriate violation proceedings for failure to inform it of transposition measures for this Directive.
I must point out that to date only Germany, Denmark, Spain and Ireland have informed the Commission of the measures they have adopted to incorporate this text, which is fundamental for sea traffic, into national law.
The situation is, however, more satisfactory with regard to port State control and classification societies, as only one Member State of the Union of Fifteen has still failed to comply by communicating the measures it has taken to transpose the Directive on port State control.
The new Member States must have incorporated all Community legislation on safety at sea into their respective legal systems by 1 May.
We are going to be absolutely firm on this point, because safety at sea is an important matter.
I am well aware of your concerns regarding compliance with international and Community regulations by Cyprus and Malta and I want to tell you that we are being especially vigilant.
Following my last speech to the Temporary Committee, the Commission services conducted on-site inspections in those countries and we were able to verify considerable progress in incorporating Community law, although it must be said that we cannot yet say that the required objectives have been achieved.
We need to continue to strengthen the administrative capacity of these countries.
We will continue to monitor this in the near future.
In the context of the application of the legislation in force you have highlighted three points.
I will spend a few moments on one of them.
With regard to places of refuge, the evaluation of plans for providing refuge for ships in distress conducted by the Commission in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency has now been completed.
In addition, last month the Agency organised a day’s workshop on this subject with the national maritime authorities, which enabled the Member States to exchange experiences on the application of Article 20 of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system.
Currently the results of the evaluation process are being analysed in detail and, as promised, the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with a report that will include the conclusions of that evaluation and also the results of a study that the Agency was charged with on compensation for damage caused by the use of a place of refuge by a ship.
Based on this information, and also taking into account what is raised in the conclusions of your report, we will assess any possible amendments or improvements to the texts adopted.
With regard to anti-pollution measures, I would like to inform you that the amendments made to the Regulation Establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, which extend its powers to combating sea pollution, have been finally approved.
The Commission will make the necessary amendments to the budget resulting from this change.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to support the Commission’s requests to provide the Agency with the necessary resources in the debates on the budget for 2005.
We also believe that the publication of the black list of vessels that are banned from entering Union ports is an essential deterrent against this type of vessel approaching or travelling along European coastlines.
As a preventive measure we are currently looking at reinforcing this concept.
With regard to the legislation currently being debated, I first of all wish to thank you for your support for the proposal for a directive establishing effective criminal sanctions for those responsible for sea pollution incidents.
The Commission joins you in calling on the Council to take a decision on this matter.
Regarding the adoption of the Regulation on the International Safety Management Code, which seeks to promote a culture of safety and prevention of pollution, the Commission would like to thank you for the support that you gave in the plenary in February, and I trust that at its meeting in June the Council will adopt common positions on both subjects.
Regarding the future prospects for maritime legislation I will say that I gave you a few clues in January, which the Commission is currently considering.
I welcome the fact that the report that we are discussing today shows that our approaches are in line with each other and I particularly note its ideas on investigations following accidents at sea, increasing traffic monitoring in Community waters, stepping up port State control and applying minimum criteria for flag states in the Union.
Some of these ideas, such as, for example, increasing the obligations of the Member States to pass on information on traffic or the role of the Agency in responses to incidents at sea are part of the plans that you have outlined for the creation of a coastguard service.
I have explained the Commission’s position on this on various occasions.
You stress, with strong arguments, the human factor and the correct application of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.
This Convention was partially incorporated into Community law in 2001, with the adoption of the Directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers.
The entry into force of the amendment to the Regulation establishing the Agency gives it powers to evaluate training for sailors provided in third countries.
I wish to finish my speech by highlighting the role that the Commission plays in terms of international relations.
This week, during our visit to Russia for the European Union/Russia Summit, as part of the Association and Cooperation agreement, we have the firm intention of pointing out that in order for the International Maritime Organisation to adopt the amendment of the MARPOL Convention, which includes an accelerated phasing out of single-hulled vessels by April 2005, Russia has undertaken to provide for early phasing out and therefore to require that it be carried out.
I would like to point out that, as has been accepted among charterers, accelerating the phasing out of single-hulled oil tankers and replacing them with double-hulled tankers is not resulting in any increase in chartering costs or in a shortage of transport capacity.
This shows that the Commission did a good job and proposed schedules that were ambitious but realistic.
The Commission is closely monitoring the work being done on the IOPC regarding the modification of the international compensation system for oil pollution.
Once again we regret the Council’s delay – and I use those words quite clearly – in requiring the Member States to ratify these agreements that have been adopted, which is going to delay the availability of the compensation if an accident occurs.
Summer is coming.
I hope that we will not have to deal with any tragedies of this nature in the next few months, but imagine the scandal if anything did happen and the Member States had not ratified the recent agreements on the level of compensation.
I would like to point out that in the meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee held in London last week, the IMO designated the Baltic, the Canary Islands and the Galapagos Islands as Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas.
In my opinion, this is a great achievement not only for the Commission, but also for the whole of the European Union, as the adoption of a series of international regulations in this field increases the protection of the interests of coastal States against the risk of pollution.
We are aware of the significance of the work done in the International Maritime Organisation and I therefore wish to reiterate my thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Community’s membership of the IMO.
In order to promote the application of satisfactory maritime regulations, the Commission actively supports and promotes the work of the International Labour Office in the process of consolidating all the agreements on international maritime regulations, with a view to adopting a single agreement to which I believe the Community should be a contracting party.
Finally, we are working in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation to increase the responsibility of the flag state through inspection systems, in other words to combat flags of convenience.
Once again, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has shown how much importance it attaches to the Commission’s work.
Following the accident more than four years ago, during your mandate I wished to help drastically improve safety at sea, and I wish to particularly thank your for the support that you have given me and say, as I said at the start of my speech, that this legislature has been the legislature of safety at sea; the legislature in which, finally, the European Union has had the ambition and the decisiveness to genuinely protect its coasts and also to work at international level with determination, will and rigour to ensure that this protection is not only applied to our coasts and our seas but to all the seas in the world.
As I have always said, the sea belongs to everyone, it is our heritage and treasure, both for humanity now and for future generations.
Vice-President of the Commission. - I am sorry.
Something must have gone wrong in the organisation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I too first of all would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, for a very well drafted report.
It is important for everyone's future to prevent the illegal manufacture of, and the trade in, firearms.
The report will help achieve this objective.
We Finns have been concerned about whether or not young people should be allowed to continue to hunt for pleasure.
The sport is subject to licence in Finland and closely supervised, and there is guidance available from experienced hunters in the safe and responsible use of weapons.
I think it is important that this best practice and long tradition in Finland will also be able to continue after the new directive has been adopted.
It is important that tomorrow we agree a carefully prepared compromise, in which the different practices in the Member States are made compatible and the Member States can allow, subject to certain conditions, the purchase and possession of firearms for the purposes of hunting for under 18-year-olds too.
Brussels, 4 May 2006
Sunscreens: Commission moves to improve labelling
And millions of citizens will be faced with the question what sunscreen product to choose in order to be adequately protected.
But there are weaknesses in the way sunscreen products are currently labelled.
One important aspect relates to the two different types of hazardous UV-radiation.
UVB radiation is the cause for “sun-burn”.
UVA radiation causes premature skin ageing, interferences with the human immune system, and is an important contributor to the skin-cancer risk.
However, the so-called ‘sun protection factor (SPF)’ only protects against sunburn (UVB radiation).
Against this background, the European Commission has launched an initiative to improve the labelling system.
Following a public consultation opened today, the Commission will issue a recommendation which will ensure that industry, as of 2007, applies a standardised, simple and understandable labelling of sunscreen products.
For more details see MEMO/06/185.
This will give consumers clear and coherent information without creating unnecessary red-tape for industry.”
Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, responsible for health and consumer protection said: “
Consumers must be made fully aware that no sunscreen product can provide 100% protection against hazardous UV-radiation.
There are serious health risks, such as skin cancer, linked to insufficient protection from the sun.
EU citizens need to be fully informed about what sunscreens will and will not do for them. ”
The Commission initiative to improve the labelling
To improve the current situation, the Commission acts to improve the way sunscreens are labelled.
Claims giving the impression of total protection, such as “sunblocker”, should disappear.
Labels should bear clear and understandable warnings and usage instructions for the consumer on how to use a sunscreen product correctly.
To achieve this, the Commission will adopt a recommendation giving guidance to industry for efficacy and claims of sunscreen products.
These guidelines will apply to all sunscreen products, including imported products, placed on the EU-market.
This will ensure a swift implementation by industry without creating additional bureaucracy.
Weaknesses of the current labelling of sunscreen products
And, there are not yet uniform testing methods to compare the strength of UVA protection.
Every producer has his own way to measure and indicate this protection, such as:
broad spectrum
100% anti UVA/UVB/IR
keeps short UVA radiation away
UVA of 30A
trengthened protection UVA
UVB absorption spectrum 30/UVA 30
25B 7A
“Sun blockers” and “total protection”?
They do not exist.
Sunscreen products should not give the misleading impression that they provide sufficient protection for babies and young children.
The correct application of the product is just as important as the choice of the product itself.
For example, in order to reach the protection indicated with the “sun protection factor”, a quantity of 2mg/cm² is required.
The quantity to cover the whole body can amount to a third of a smaller bottle.
Moreover, this quantity has to be re-applied frequently.
What should consumers know for this summer?
Consumers should at any rate use sunscreen products.
But the Commission advises to choose sunscreen products protecting against UVA and UVB radiation.
It is important to know for consumers that sunscreen products should only be one of a number of measures to protect from the UV radiation of the sun, such as:
Avoiding excessive sun exposure at peak hours, when the sun is strongest;
Wearing protective clothing, hats and sun glasses;
Babies and young children should not be exposed to direct sun light at all.
Facts about the sunscreen industry
The EU is a very important and continuously-growing market for the sunscreens industry.
In 2004, the estimated retail value (retail sales price) of sunscreen products in Europe was approximately € 1.3 billion.
In 2005, sales have increased by 4% in the EU.

China’s Evolving Economic System
It is generally agreed that China’s impressive economic achievements during the last three decades are largely the result of the radical reform of its economic system.
While private ownership of firms hardly existed when these reforms started, private firms today account for about 60% of total production.
Ownership, however, is only one dimension of an economic system.
China’s economic system has changed just as drastically in other ways as well.
Decision-making regarding consumption and production has largely been decentralized to individual households and firms, respectively; economic incentives, markets, competition, and internationalization have to a considerable extent replaced command, administrative processes, monopoly, and autarky.
Generally speaking, China’s reform period has been a stark contemporary illustration of the historical lesson that unleashing individual initiative tends to boost economic development.
How, then, should today’s Chinese economy be characterized?
Some observers describe China’s current economic system as “state capitalism”; others (including China’s rulers) call it “market socialism.”
Both labels mislead.
One reason is the domination of private firms on the production side.
Another is the fact that “socialism” usually does not rely upon strong economic incentives and competition, which are the dominant economic factors in today’s China.
In fact, China is a type of mixed economy , with a number of specific features, some of which favor GDP growth, while others have not dragged down the economy to any considerable extent so far.
But this situation is likely to change.
So further reforms will be decisive in determining the Chinese economy’s future performance.
Although internationalization of the economy has served China well, it is unlikely that the current 35% share of GDP claimed by exports and the heavy reliance on foreign technology are sustainable in the long run.
Tension between widespread private ownership of firms and pervasive public ownership of assets is another specific feature of China’s economic system that looks similarly creaky.
For example, by disfavoring lending to private firms, state-owned banks distort the allocation of resources.
Chinese agriculture provides another example of tension between private entrepreneurship and public-sector ownership of assets.
In particular, public ownership of land harms the investment incentives for family farms and reduces their chance of consolidating land holdings in order to exploit economies of scale.
Reducing this tension over ownership of firms and assets is imperative, because the entry and expansion of small private companies will be increasingly important when China’s domestic markets and domestic innovation need to play a greater role.
Thus, for China to gain maximum advantage from private entrepreneurship, it is important to continue shifting the share of financial assets and land holdings out of the public sector.
This would also help address the endemic corruption that is also a specific feature of the Chinese economic system.
Corruption is difficult to reduce drastically so long as politicians and bureaucrats have much “to sell” to firms and individuals – including rationed loans from public-sector banks and regulatory permits of various types.
In rural areas, corruption emanates from frequent expropriation of land-lease contracts held by farmers working on collectively owned land, which local officials then turn over to non-agriculture land developers.
In both cases, reducing corruption will require not only government pep talks against bad ethics, but also institutional reforms, including further deregulation, stronger property rights, and more privately owned assets.
Free media would also help.
No doubt, some types of corruption, including “asset stripping” in connection with the privatization of public-sector firms, has speeded up the emergence of a class of private capitalists and entrepreneurs.
But if corruption becomes a permanent element of China’s economic system, it is likely to both reduce the efficiency of the allocation of resources and damage the legitimacy of private entrepreneurship.
China also needs to shift from its highly “extensive” (resource consuming) growth strategy to a more “intensive” development path.
Although high growth requires large-scale capital formation, the relation between investment in real capital assets and human capital in China seems to be out of proportion.
This is reflected in the current investment ratio for real capital assets of 43% of GDP, compared to 4.3% investment in human capital in the form of education.
China’s growth would be more efficient if these proportions changed in favor of education, including vocational training, which is very poorly developed.
Moreover, eliminating today’s vast wastage of natural resources, which underpins exceptionally high levels of pollution, will require a reformed regulatory framework, including higher user prices for energy, raw materials, and environmental resources.
By shifting to a less resource-dependent development strategy, more resources would be available for improvements in the country’s much neglected social arrangements, particularly among rural citizens and “urban outsiders” (individuals in informal urban sectors).
This includes addressing China’s patchy arrangements for income security, as well as its unevenly distributed provision of social services, such as health and education, in particular, in rural areas.
The case for combining further government withdrawal from the production system with more engagement in the social field is compelling.
China’s leaders seem to be promising this by voicing their concern for domestic entrepreneurship, social arrangements, rural development and environmental protection.
Only time can tell to what extent, and how fast, such promises will be fulfilled.
author. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, wine is not simply an agricultural product for us, but also represents culture and tradition.
We have often heard in this Chamber that we must guarantee the European wine market a certain future.
We can only ensure this if we focus on quality and we cannot achieve quality if we do not respect traditional production methods.
For this reason, Commissioner, we can only oppose the introduction of new wine production practices that have been dreamed up and have nothing to do with the science of winemaking, because we believe that they can lead to a deterioration in the image of wine and detract from the relationship of trust between consumer and products, with severe consequences for quality and perhaps even for health.
European quality products enjoy their status because they are based on a respect for ingredients, small-scale production methods, tradition and characteristic flavours achieved using specific products and production methods.
I am afraid that by making all these concessions, overturning our traditional winemaking practices, the Union will allow pieces of the wooden casks to be added to speed up the flavouring process, and this will lead to artificial flavouring, and before we know it, we will be adding water and making wine without grapes.
I do not think this is the right way, Commissioner, to relaunch and develop the internal and international market sector.
International demand for rosé wine is not falling but rising, and in this case the right approach is not to produce more using winemaking practices that owe more to a chemistry set than anything else, but to invest in quality, in specialisation and in the characterisation of European wines, in the marketing and promotion of real wine in general in order to extend the market and finally make it easier for young people to enter the winemaking business.
Brussels, 7 June 2002
Presenting the reform proposals for the common fisheries policy (CFP) in Madrid today, Franz Fischler, Commissioner for agriculture, rural development and fisheries, said that the Commission derived no pleasure whatsoever from voicing the harsh truth that the EU fishing fleet is too big.
"It is totally short-sighted to accuse the Commission of wishing to destroy jobs.
Although in the short term the necessary reduction in fishing effort will lead to a reduction in employment, in the long term it is the only way to safeguard jobs in the fishing industry,"said the Commission.
"Some people here in Spain give the impression that it would be in the fishermen's interest NOT to reform the industry.
If instead of changing the CFP we bury our heads in the sand and ignore the problem, our fishing industry will suffer death by a thousand cuts."
Fischler called on all parties involved to get back to a discussion of real content and to base their criticisms on facts in the interests of a sensible dialogue.
Fischler warned against repeating past mistakes.
"We need only look at Newfoundland to see what will happen if we do not take action.
Cod disappeared there 20 years ago and has not bounced back to this day because of procrastinating politicians.
No fisherman now fishes for cod there any more.
Do you really think that these fishermen, who have lost their fishing grounds and with them their jobs, are grateful to the politicians?"
Fischler stressed that this was not an anti-south reform.
"The reform is in the best interests of the whole EU fishing industry and affects all Member States.
Our proposal is based neither on the principle of equal treatment nor on discrimination, but is purely and simply a response to the state of stocks in the various EU waters.
This means of course that not all Member States can be affected equally.
Thankfully, however, the stock situation is better in the south than, for example, in the North Sea.
The impact of the reform will therefore be less pronounced in the south, not greater."
The Commissioner rebutted criticism that the reform discriminated against Spain.
"The facts tell a different story.
Spain is the EU country which benefits most from the CFP.
Roughly half of the €3.7 billion provided for in the fisheries Structural Fund goes to Spain.
Italy - in second position - receives 11% of the funding, the United Kingdom just 6%.
Vessels which catch fish in order to produce fishmeal will naturally also be subject to restrictions and management plans.
It should be borne in mind, however, that over 90% of industrial fishing targets fish stocks which are neither endangered nor suitable for human consumption."
"On the contrary, countries like Spain that kept to their fleet reduction targets are in a better position than those that did not abide by the rules.
Countries that failed to cut fleets sufficiently will simply be refused any more aid apart from for purposes of scrapping.
They may if necessary be penalised by cuts in their fishing rights."
The objectives of the MAGP were simply too modest for that.
For example: while the capacity of the Spanish fleet has been reduced by 26% more than required by the EU, the number of fish landed in Spain has remained the same.
He stressed that the Commission took its social responsibility very seriously.
"This is why we will submit an Action Plan to cushion the social effects of the reform.
We must find alternative sources of employment for the affected fishermen.
The Commission expects several more million euros to be made available after 2004 for extra social welfare measures.
http://europa.eu.int/comm/fisheries/policy_en.htm
in writing. - (PT) This explanation of vote is intended to point out that, by recognising the mediation efforts begun by neighbouring countries, by the Southern African Development Community and by the African Union, we believe that the Kenyan people will be able to find and define their own path.
It is up to the Kenyan people themselves to find the solutions to overcome the current situation in their country.
As a result, we regard as negative any attempt by the EU to interfere, as indicated and proposed in the resolution, particularly bearing in mind the objectives proclaimed by the EU in its 'Strategy for Africa' and the framework of inter-imperialist cooperation/rivalry concerning this continent that is also clearly evident and that is so deeply felt in this region.
Finally, I must highlight the omission from the resolution of a reference to the severe and deteriorating socio-economic situation in this country - which is at the root of the expression of popular discontent manifested in the elections - and the deep responsibility for this situation of the neo-liberal policies promoted, in particular, by the international financial institutions, major capitalist powers and their transnational companies.
The European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund have proved to be effective and extremely useful instruments for territorial development and for tackling the consequences of the economic crisis which has afflicted Europe and the world for some time now.
In this regard, I welcome the proposals to simplify the procedures for the decommitment of the funds and to facilitate payments to the beneficiaries of the various programmes implemented using the aforesaid funds.
Furthermore, I am in favour of providing an additional pre-financing instalment for 2010 for the Member States worst hit by the crisis.
author. - (PL) Mr President, little has changed in Uzbekistan since the last European Parliament resolution on the situation in that country and the republics of Central Asia.
The Government of Uzbekistan has still not agreed to an independent inquiry into the events that took place on 13 May 2005 in Andijan, where troops sent in by President Karimov crushed a popular uprising.
Several hundred people died in that bloodbath, which the government referred to as a terrorist rebellion.
Most independent journalists and human rights defenders are being intimidated by the security services and some have been exiled from the country.
The recent disappearance of Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov has caused great concern about the future development of Uzbekistan.
Mr Karimov and Mr Khaidarov are said to be the last remaining journalists in the country who have dared to write critically about the government and its leader for the last 17 years.
When these two men were located a few days later, one had received a prison sentence for blackmail, and the other had been committed to a psychiatric hospital.
Civil society in Uzbekistan is demanding a more open society, where personal freedoms and human rights are respected.
The people of Uzbekistan would also like to see real progress along the road to democracy.
The war on terror must be fought without infringing international conventions.
It must never serve as a pretext for annihilating the political opposition, riding roughshod over human rights or restricting civil liberties.

Invitation letter by President Van Rompuy
to the European Council
We will meet this coming Thursday and Friday for our June European Council.
We will start at 19:30 with the customary meeting with the President of the European Parliament.
I will use that opportunity to give my view on the work ahead for our meetings over the next months.
The dinner, starting at 20:00, will allow for an in-depth discussion of economic issues.
We will take stock of the progress on the various elements of the comprehensive approach agreed upon in March: the six legislative proposals on economic governance, the amendment to the EFSF, the future ESM.
I look forward to our discussion on the recommendations proposed by the Commission and on the commitments made under the Euro Plus Pact.
As agreed before, we need to take full ownership of the process in order to improve Europe's economic governance.
By endorsing the country-specific recommendations we will close the first European Semester.
We will also discuss recent developments in the euro zone.
Finally, we will confirm agreement on the nomination of Mr Draghi as the future President of the European Central Bank.
Following the good work of the Council, we should reassert the importance of free movement and give orientations for future work on such key issues as Schengen governance, border management, partnerships with third countries in the Southern Mediterranean, and our Common European Asylum Policy.
The lunch, the last session of our work, will be devoted to a political discussion on our Southern Neighbourhood policy and the situation in some of the countries concerned, particularly Libya.
We will also touch on the situation in Syria and look at the best way to give a new perspective to the Middle East Peace Process.
The discussion will be reflected as appropriate in a short declaration.
The European Commission and the European Parliament are in favour of abolishing guidelines on the amounts of tobacco and alcohol that consumers may bring into their own country for their personal use from another Member State.
What efforts has the Presidency made to convince the Council to agree to the abolition of these guidelines and thus allow shoppers to exercise their full single market rights?
Did the Global Order Die with Khashoggi?
WASHINGTON, DC – Earlier this month, Jamal Khashoggi – a Washington Post columnist and prominent critic of the Saudi government – walked into Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents that would enable him to marry his Turkish fiancée.
Instead of receiving help from his country’s government, he was tortured, murdered, and dismembered by a team of its agents.
It is a shocking crime that raises some serious questions, not least regarding the appropriate balance between defending human rights and maintaining long-standing (and lucrative) alliances.
More fundamentally, the sheer brazenness with which the Saudi government had Khashoggi killed – not to mention Western leaders’ weak response – has underscored for people around the world just how coldly calculated geopolitical machinations really are.
Transparency is usually a virtue to be encouraged.
Here, however, the revelation comes at a cost.
The belief that principles, values, and rules hold at least some weight in international relations has a stabilizing effect.
As that belief is shaken – say, by the poisoning earlier this year of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter on British soil – the global order is damaged, perhaps beyond repair.
The delegitimizing effect of such episodes is exacerbated by a broader abandonment of formalities – such as workplace dress codes and standards for communication – that has been fueled by the rise of social media.
As our public and private lives are blurred, public figures are under pressure to appear as “real” and “normal” as our neighbors and colleagues.
Even Pope Francis has released a rock album.
Of course, not all of these shifts are necessarily bad.
The breakdown of formal structures can create space for independent thinking and innovation.
The danger comes when no new framework emerges to help guide our behavior – and, more important, the behavior of our leaders – to ensure that it adheres to some shared values or reasonable expectations.
US President Donald Trump embodies this risk.
Since coming onto the political scene, Trump has shattered expectations about how a US presidential candidate – and, subsequently, a US president – should behave.
While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with a political leader communicating frankly and directly with his or her constituents, the tone and style of Trump’s delivery – largely via Twitter – is highly damaging.
His below-the-belt insults, racist dog whistles, and unfounded attacks on the media and other democratic institutions are deepening political and social divisions, while diminishing respect for the presidency and the US more generally.
Trump’s unprecedentedly transactional – and highly erratic – approach to foreign policy is similarly destabilizing.
To be sure, Trump’s deal-making was initially framed to some extent by broader values, especially increasing the “fairness” of US relationships, from security cooperation with NATO allies to trade ties with China.
Despite Trump’s “America first” rhetoric, such actions seemed to be focused more on rebalancing the system than destroying it.
Trump’s response to the Khashoggi episode, however, is fully decoupled from any overarching values.
To be clear, US presidents, together with European leaders, have been coddling Saudi Arabia for decades, and leaders worldwide often base their foreign-policy decisions on realpolitik, rather than moral considerations.
But this is the first time a US president has unabashedly acknowledged the purely transactional nature of their policy decisions.
The Saudis, Trump declares bluntly, are “spending $110 billion on military equipment and on things that create jobs” in the US.
“I don’t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the United States.”
Notwithstanding the dubiousness of the figures involved, Trump’s comments are a bald statement of monetized interest. The comfort, even pride, with which he makes such statements indicates that we really have entered a new era, in which we cannot expect our leaders to clear even the low bar of trying to fit their decisions into a rules- or values-based narrative.
This is dangerous, because such narratives are vital to maintain the credibility of the global order and the support of domestic constituencies for it.
Just like effective leadership and respect for the rule of law, a certain amount of faith in the system – even if it is qualified by frustration with inequality or impunity – is essential to its survival.
A world in which all that matters is the deal, in which there is no ethos guiding our actions and underpinning our governance systems, is one where citizens do not know what to expect from their leaders and countries do not know what to expect from their allies.
Such an unpredictable and unstable world is not one that we should blindly accept.
It is not too late to respond to Khashoggi’s brutal murder in a way that reinforces, rather than undermines, the rules on which we all depend.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia is a good start, even if it was driven largely by her desire to shore up support for her Christian Democratic Union ahead of regional elections in Hesse; so, too, is the current pushback from Washington against a business-as-usual approach to Saudi Arabia.
But more must be done, with principled leaders declaring clearly that what happened in Istanbul is not acceptable.
Otherwise, we will effectively be giving up the discourse of values and rules – a decision that could well leave us with no coherent and stabilizing discourse at all.
The number of entrants was up by more than 400 compared to last year and was the highest since the launch of the contest in 2007.
“ This contest encourages pupils to get to grips with foreign languages in a deeper way and to consider using their knowledge in their future career, whether as a translator or in any other professional field where multilingualism is an asset, " said Androulla Vassiliou, Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth.
“The contest also inspires schools to learn from each other and try out different methods of language teaching. ”
The winners all demonstrate that a knowledge of languages can take you further and open your mind to new possibilities.
The German winner, for instance, wanted to go to a music school in Hungary, so as well as perfecting her skills on the flute and piano, she also learnt to speak Hungarian.
With her knowledge of French, German, Dutch, English and Spanish, the Luxembourg winner truly embodies her country's multilingual tradition.
The contestants all translated a one-page text based on their choice of any of the 506 language combinations possible among the EU’s 23 official languages.
Although many chose English as a source language, the total number of language combinations used was 148, which was the highest since the launch of the competition.
The theme of this year's texts was volunteering (to mark the European Year of Volunteering 2011), but each language test featured different facets of the subject: the Dutch text, for instance, focused on restoring a church in Tuscany; the French translation paper focused on beach cleaning, the Polish one on working in a Chilean school for under-privileged children.
A number of the teenagers who sat the contest in different countries were clearly inspired by the volunteering theme, with some deciding to enrol as volunteers for the Red Cross and other NGOs afterwards.
Background
The ‘Juvenes Translatores’ (Latin for ‘young translators’) contest is organised every year by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation.
It is open to 17-year old secondary school pupils (this time for those born in 1994) and takes place at the same time in all selected schools all over Europe.
The contest ran for the first time in 2007 as a pilot project to give young people a taste of what it is like to be a translator and to raise the profile of language learning in schools.
The contest has encouraged some of the entrants to take up language studies and to become translators.
The names of the winning students (plus their chosen language combination) and their schools are:

Mr President, everyone has the right to a clean and healthy environment and nobody should endanger the health and lives of other people.
This principle should be the cornerstone not just of our environmental policy, but of our would-be Constitution as well.
People have the right to clean air, and politicians and industrialists have the responsibility to guarantee that right.
Some decades ago, industry was the main cause of air pollution and the diseases connected with it.
With technological changes, industry became less polluting but, as the number of cars increased, the situation did not improve.
Eighty per cent of our citizens live in cities and for them the main cause of air pollution is traffic.
During the PSE Group hearing on air pollution, we had clear evidence of this. If we want to provide cleaner air for our citizens, we should change our traffic policy in cities.
In cities with polluted air we have to reduce individual car traffic and improve public transport.
The strict pollution reduction targets, as proposed for particulate matter, can only be achieved in that way. That should be the main target, but we also have to reduce dangerous emissions from cars, with cleaner engines, fuels and filters, as indicated in the Euro 5 and Euro 6 proposals.
When human lives are at stake, wishful thinking and soft recommendations are not enough. We need binding targets and strict regulations.
Annual and daily limit values are also needed.
Limit values must be low and strict but, on the other hand, they should reflect reality.
It is better to lower them step by step than to set up unrealistic measures and allow them to be ignored.
My last words are to Mr Sjöstedt: Jonas.
in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which challenges an authorised claim about baby food.
The authorised claim is about DHA, a fatty acid found naturally in breast milk, which, in breast milk, is known to be important in the development of babies' vision.
However, the synthesised DHA which is added to formula milk is different.
Formula milk producer Mead Johnson has applied to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) for permission to use the health claim 'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake contributes to the normal visual development of infants up to 12 months of age'.
The claim has been authorised, based on evidence supplied by Mead Johnson.
However, an independent review of all the available evidence on DHA in formula milk in 2008 found that adding DHA to formula milk 'had no proven benefit regarding vision, cognition or physical growth'.
Furthermore, no studies were submitted to EFSA that showed the effect of giving a baby follow-on formula supplemented with DHA after feeding the baby non-supplemented infant formula from birth.
As this claim would only be allowed on follow-on formulas, this is crucial.
I voted against the report because it once again seeks to introduce abortion by the back door.
Otherwise, it is simply a series of platitudes.
High Representative Catherine Ashton nominates the top management of the External Action Service
Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission has today announced the appointment of Pierre Vimont as the Executive Secretary General of the future External Action Service and David O’Sullivan as its Chief Operating Officer.
"I promised to appoint the brightest and best and in Pierre Vimont as the Executive Secretary General, and David O'Sullivan as Chief Operating Officer I have done just that.
Pierre Vimont is described as the “diplomats' diplomat” with a career spanning over more than 30 years.
During that time he was chief of staff for three French Foreign Ministers and Minister for European Affairs.
He was the Permanent Representative of France to the European Union in Brussels for four years, where he was considered outstanding during the French Presidency of the Council in 2000.
He has also been posted in London and most recently in Washington as the Ambassador of France to the United States.
In his 30-year career he was Director and Director General (DG Education and DG Trade), member of the Cabinet of two commissioners, head of the cabinet of Commission President Romano Prodi before eventually being appointed Secretary General of the European Commission.
The remaining vacant positions of the EAS management team will be filled in the coming weeks.

“We need to build a society-wide consensus on the future of RFID.
We need to ensure that RFID technology delivers on its economic potential and to create the right opportunities for its use for the wider public good, while ensuring that citizens remain in control of their data.
In a Communication planned for December 2006, the European Commission intends to assume these twin responsibilities.
To prevent the possibility of a fragmented approach to RFID in Europe, the European Commission has set out an ambitious timeline for the adoption of a policy environment that stimulates the use of RFID technology while providing safeguards for personal data.
Four months into the initiative, the launch of the public online consultation today marks the start of the second phase of the open and interactive debate.
Industry stakeholders and the general public are now invited to respond to questions on the ‘Your voice in Europe’ website.
A final conference, scheduled for October 2006, will present the main outcomes of the workshops and the online consultation to an audience of experts and decision-makers.
This event will enable the Commission to report on its assessment of the consultation initiatives and to collect the final views of the stakeholders before preparing the Communication to European Parliament and Council.

For the second consecutive year, the European Commission is supporting the International Missing Children's Day on 25 May, organized by the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children.
Vice-President Franco Frattini pointed out that "the Commission has for a long time been concerned about the protection of children and young people inside and outside of Europe.
The problem of missing children is complex and multifaceted.
It is today not possible to obtain comprehensive statistics across the European Union regarding missing and sexually exploited children.
Data gathering is seldom organised at a national level and the available data are largely difficult to access and little or no details can be obtained.
To give an indication on the extent of the problem in some European countries, the following statistics can be obtained from national sources:
In Belgium, the number of dossiers reported by the police was 1.022 in 2005[2];
In the UK, police recorded 846 cases of child abductions in 2002/03[3] , while the total cases of missing children (runaways for any reason) is estimated at 70.000 annually[4].
To strengthen its actions in favour of children and young people, the Commission will issue a Communication “Towards an EU strategy on children’s rights” in July 2006.
The communication will propose a wide action plan, with four major objectives:
To identify priorities for future EU action
To improve EU policies’ effectiveness vis-à-vis the Rights of the Child
To increase cooperation with stakeholders
To help children to enforce their rights
Many actions have already been taken by the European Union to protect the rights of the child.
In addition, the Commission provides funding through a dozen community programmes for actions in favour of children and young people.
Children
Who said you are all born equal?
Children without dreams, child soldiers
Blessed children, castle princes
Or children battered by every ill
Who said you are all born equal?
Can you believe the world is beautiful?
Beggar children of Calcutta,
Disfigured more to earn even more
Children, children
Children of the pitiless ghettos
Whose only play is with drawn knives
Children with no tears and no look in their eyes
Children extinguished, old-men children
Children, children
Children of grown-ups’ folly
Children of hell, of nothingness
Children
Children of yachts, of beautiful waters
Or children of the junks and rafts
Who said you are all born equal?
Children with hunger-stricken mothers
Clinging to their withered breasts
Can you believe the world is beautiful?
To the child whose days are without bread
The child who tomorrow will be dead
If you forget him
Children of each and every colour
Children of a thousand and one sorrows
Who said you are all born equal?

Mr President, I am glad that Commissioner Frattini is here to hear me address the next item.
In a recent statement, the Dutch Minister for Integration, Mrs Verdonk, announced a change in the return policy for homosexuals and Christian asylum seekers from Iran.
She said that since homosexuality and Christianity are not outlawed in Iran, asylum seekers can simply return home.
Whilst this may, strictly speaking, be true, in practice, homosexuals and Christians have good reason to fear for their safety.
It is a fact that homosexual activity carries the death penalty.
My question to Commissioner Frattini is whether the Commission intends to find out whether Dutch return policy is in line with the European minimum standards for asylum seekers as laid down by the directive that is required to be implemented by October of this year, and whether it is in line with international agreements.
. I wish to congratulate Mr Guellec on his important and timely report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development, which has my backing.
I particularly welcome the paragraph on the need to apply this concept across the various Community policies, with the aim of improving the coordination of territorial planning in Europe.
This will, in turn, ensure the success of the enlargement and enhance the EU’s competitiveness on the world stage.
In order to set out appropriately the EU’s action in this area, and the level of intervention in each region, the report calls for the creation of new territorial criteria and indicators, alongside GDP, for measuring development in a particular region and for assessing the obstacles hindering that development, namely specific territorial constraints, a remoteness and accessibility index, infrastructure and transport provision, the amount of research, innovation, education and training and the level of diversification of productivity in the area.

EESC studies the waste strategy and the natural resources strategy
The resources strategy generates information for the thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, supporting it in reducing waste.
The EESC strongly regrets that no proposals are made with regard to the introduction of standardised financial instruments throughout the EU.
One of the EESC's main criticisms is that the Commission document does not give thorough consideration to the issue of non-renewable resources.
Conversely, it is obvious that for the preservation of certain natural resources (such as fish stocks) there is no more time to waste, so concrete and immediate action is needed in these areas.

The European Economic and Social Committee represents the various economic and social components of organised civil society.
It is an institutional consultative body established by the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
Its consultative role enables its members, and hence the organisations they represent, to participate in the Community decision-making process.
Mr President, I am pleased that the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs can be presented in plenary after all; that was not the case a few weeks ago.
I agree with the Commission's basic idea that the administrative burden on small enterprises must be reduced and that - as Mr Lehne said - a distinction must be drawn between large and small enterprises.
Yet the proposal on the table does not achieve this objective, which explains the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
If there are no annual accounts available, it makes it more difficult for small enterprises to obtain information about colleagues.
At present, we are seeing different situations in different Member States, which I do not welcome, particularly in the case of small enterprises, who are not specialists in such things.
Therefore, I wish to ask my fellow Members to support our position.
What we are calling for is a comprehensive impact assessment, covering not only the 6.3 billion positive consequences but also the negative impact; this has been an omission on the Commission's part.
Administrative simplification would be best carried out as part of the revision of the Company Law Directives, as it would then affect everyone equally.
Within this framework, simplifications could be made and distinctions drawn.
Thirdly, we would end up with a uniform directive for all Member States, a stronger internal market and genuine administrative simplification.
This should be more than just a day of celebration for citizens.
" How does it work?
Who decides?
What comes next?
These are all questions that people are asking about Europe.
Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič added: "
Europe Day is always a good moment for citizens to find out more about what we do.
And this year, we have made it easier than ever before, thanks to the new Visitors' Centre.
It's our shop window for everybody who wants to learn about the great adventure of European integration ."
Citizens will be able to go behind the scenes in the Berlaymont building – the Commission's headquarters where the 27 Commissioners go about their daily work.
A number of activities and exhibitions will give citizens the opportunity to learn more about what the European Union is and how it impacts upon their daily lives.
Across the street, at 11:15 Vice-President Reding and Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič will inaugurate the improved Visitors' Centre which will then be open to the public as of 14:00.
The Centre was previously located in Rue van Maerlant and has now been relocated to sit in the Charlemagne Building, 170 Rue de la Loi (next to the Berlaymont headquarters), at the heart of EU law-making.
Throughout the year 2013, Vice-President Reding and her fellow Commissioners have been joining forces with national and local politicians in holding debates with citizens all across Europe – to listen to them and answer their questions.

Background
A lot has been achieved in the twenty years since the introduction of EU Citizenship: A newly published EU survey shows that today 63% of citizens feel "European".
Across the EU, citizens are using their rights on a daily basis.
But people are not always aware of these rights.
That is why the European Commission kicked off the European Year of Citizens (IP/13/2 ), a year dedicated to citizens and their rights.
Throughout the year, members of the Commission will hold debates with citizens about their expectations for the future in Citizens' Dialogues (townhall meetings) all over the EU.

ITEMS DEBATED
coexistence of genetically modified crops with conventional and organic farming
The Council took note of the presentation by the Commission of its Recommendation and held a substantive political discussion on the main concerns relating to the coexistence of genetically modified crops with conventional and organic farming, on the basis of a questionnaire prepared by the Presidency.
Delegations generally welcomed this recommendation as a first major step towards applying measures that would ensure such coexistence within the Community on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity and confirmed that such measures should be developed and applied by the Member States in line with the recent Decision of the Council and of the European Parliament to amend Directive 2001/18/EC.
In this connection, it should be noted that the European Commission undertook to submit a report on the experience gained in the Member States in the two years following the publication of the Recommendation including, if appropriate, an assessment of all possible and necessary steps to take.
1) As regards GMO-free zones, the Member States noted the possibility of considering regional measures in accordance with the principles of proportionality and specificity.
Several delegations stated that measures for guaranteeing coexistence should take account of the different plant varieties and regional peculiarities.
A number of delegations asked for a definition of GMO-free zones.
2) A number of delegations requested the rapid adoption of tolerance thresholds for the adventitious presence of GMOs in seeds, while others considered it unnecessary in principle to lay down thresholds that were different from those covered by the current rules.
3) A number of delegations wondered about the need for a specific tolerance threshold for the adventitious presence of GMOs in organic agriculture and wanted this issue to be discussed in detail.
4) A large number of delegations wanted to examine whether it would be possible to lay down Community-level rules on liability in the event of contamination of conventional and organic crops by genetically modified crops.
They referred in particular to the potential risks of distortions of competition between Member States.
COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION REFORM OF THE TOBACCO, OLIVE OIL, COTTON AND SUGAR SECTORS (AND DANISH REQUEST UNDER "OTHER BUSINESS")
The Council asked the Special Committee on Agriculture to start discussions forthwith to examine the various sectors covered by the communication and to submit its reports as soon as possible.

AGRICULTURE
The Council formally adopted the seven Regulations on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, without debate and by a qualified majority, the Portuguese delegation voting against the "horizontal" Regulation and the Regulation establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector.
Statements by the Council, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland, the United Kingdom, Portugal (giving reasons for voting against) and the Commission are appended to the legal texts adopted.
common rules for direct support schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy and support schemes for producers of certain crops (horizontal Regulation)
rural development
the market in cereals
the market in milk and milk products
a levy in the milk and milk products sector.
This reform of the CAP, four years after the Agenda 2000 reform which continued the trend begun in 1992 of progressive reduction of budgetary financing (price support) and increasing financial compensation in the form of direct aid to producers, is the most radical change since the foundation of the CAP in 1958.
It develops the second pillar of the CAP relating to rural development through increases in horizontal aid, separate from production activity.
Intervention prices (e.g. in the durum wheat sector, the rice sector) and Community support (e.g. in the nuts sector) are reduced, with partial compensation provided for these reductions or with incentives to quality production.
Part of Community aid nevertheless remains coupled to production, in particular in the cereals sector, oilseeds and protein crops (25% coupled), potato starch (60% of aid), durum wheat (40% of supplementary aid per hectare) and the beef and veal sector (several options are proposed).
Thus, the reform should allow the Community to ensure greater compliance with its international commitments vis-à-vis the World Trade Organisation, in particular by transferring almost all production-related aid, which produces a distorting effect on production and trade ("orange" and "blue" boxes in WTO terminology) to "green box" aid with no or, at most, minimal distorting effects.
The green box must be financed from public funds (not by imposing higher prices on consumers) and must not involve price support.
With regard to the horizontal Regulation, the impossibility of making fruit and vegetable producers eligible for the decoupled payment is tempered by a derogation taking account of production during the reference period.

By a qualified majority, with the Belgian and Netherlands delegations voting against, and the German delegation abstaining, the Council adopted the common position with a view to adoption of the Regulation laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency.
By a qualified majority, the Belgian and Netherlands delegations voting against, the Council adopted the common position with a view to the adoption of the Directive amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.
The Council unanimously adopted the common position amending Directive 2001/82/EC on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products.

Brussels, 11 December 2001
Commission rules that fiscal advantages to Italian banks are incompatible with State aid rules
Italy must now recover the amounts that the banks, benefitting from tax exemptions, avoided having to pay.
The status of these measures still needs to be defined.
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti commented : «
In recent years the Commission has examined State Aid measures to banks in different Member States with particular attention.
Such measures distort competition and are obstacles to the development of a true single market in financial services which would be to the advantage of consumers, savers and companies alike.
I would just mention the Commission's decisions in the Crédit Lyonnais case (three decisions, taken in 1995, 1996 and 1998 respectively), or concerning the Westdeutsche Landesbank in 1999.
Last July we secured a commitment from the German Government to eliminate the guarantees to the public banks in Germany, and a decision in the case of the French bank Crédit Mutuel will be taken soon".
It is therefore likely that the actual tax savings made by the banks are substantially lower than the above figure.
exemption from tax for the transfer to banking foundations of holdings held by banks in the capital of the Banca d'Italia;
tax neutrality for transactions in which goods and holdings in ancillary activities are disposed of;
the imposition of a fixed amount replacing the indirect taxes normally due in connection with mergers;
tax neutrality with respect to the local tax due on the increase in the value of property at the time of change in ownership.
These measures confer an advantage on banks, enabling them to grow in size and benefit from economies of scale at a lower cost.
This advantage has a selective nature.
It discriminates within the sector, since it is limited to only those companies involved in merger or restructuring operations.
Moreover, the first of the aid measures listed above is not neutral with respect to the size of the acquiring company.
Accordingly, if the purchaser has a smaller business than the purchased, its fiscal advantage will be lower than the one accruing to a hypothetical larger buyer of the same bank.
In addition, since what matters is the size of the business in Italy which is typically smaller for foreign banks this discrimination is not only taking place within the sector, but also between foreign and Italian banks.
The Commission also examined whether the special fiscal treatment could be considered as restructuring aid.
However, the conditions for applying the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty are not present.
The aid was not notified individually to the Commission.
The banks that benefit from the aid are not in difficulties nor is the aid intended to restore the firms' long-term viability.
Finally, the guidelines require that measures must be taken to mitigate as far as possible any adverse effects of the aid on competitors (usually this takes the form of a reduced market presence of the company after its restructuring).
No such situation is envisaged in the present case.
Mr President, the countries of Europe are linked to Latin America by close historical, cultural and human ties.
As a Spaniard and, what is more, a Galician, I am very aware of that.
In addition, we share principles and values that are also a result of our Christian heritage.
Latin America and the European Union are, in general, natural partners, and we must intensify our relations.
I am delighted that there is broad agreement in this House on the fact that the European Union should establish strategic relations with both Mexico and Brazil.
I said as much myself with regard to Mexico in April last year during a debate here in Parliament on the Lima summit.
The strategic partnership should be accompanied by regular yearly summits.
We have held them with Brazil since 2007, and the Salafranca report rightly calls for them in relation to Mexico, in view of the Council's somewhat ambiguous conclusions of October 2008.
I hope such a summit may be held with Mexico this year.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's strategic partnership with Mexico and Brazil is highly beneficial at both bilateral and global levels.
Bilaterally, there is ample potential for the relations to grow.
In the case of Mexico, for example, the association agreement has resulted in a spectacular increase in trade and investment.
The fight against organised crime and drug trafficking and cooperation in the field of energy are other areas where joint cooperation is necessary, as well as greater coordination in multilateral forums.
In the case of Brazil, the intensification of relations should also help to unblock the EU-Mercosur Agreement.
I should like to highlight the positive economic results achieved by Mexico and Brazil throughout this decade, in contrast to previous periods.
Without that progress, which has been due to well-conceived policies, the current extreme world crisis would have devastated their economies.
In contrast, their governments can now use the reserves they have built up to implement anticyclical policies in the same way as the developed and some emerging countries.
Mexico and Brazil are also playing an increasingly important role on the world stage.
They take part in the Heiligendamm process and, as major economic powers in Latin America, they are members of the G20.
In today's complex and interconnected world - I am just finishing - with all its global challenges and threats, including climate change, cooperating in a spirit of shared responsibility with players as significant as Mexico and Brazil is highly beneficial for the European Union and also, of course, for the whole international community.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget for the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th European Development Funds (EDFs) for the financial year 2006 on the basis of the report recommending that Parliament should grant discharge by Mr Fjellner, who in fact took over the very good work by Mr Stubb, who has been appointed a minister in the Finnish Government.
Like many Members, I regret that the EDF was not budgetised under the financial perspective 2007 to 2013 and such budgetisation should be a priority objective for the multiannual financial framework after 2013.
In the meantime, the procedures for management of the EDF should be simplified, in particular by making it possible to close previous EDFs as early as possible and by standardising their financial rules.
With the start of a 10th EDF in 2008, there are no less than four EDFs for the Commission to manage simultaneously.
Finally, I am surprised at the sum of EUR 10.3 billion of 'outstanding commitments' which is 25% of the total funds committed, and it is imperative that the Commission should reduce these funds still more drastically, especially old and dormant commitments.
I voted in favour of the report as the Commission needs to increase the resources allocated to the fight against drug trafficking.
The aid granted by the EU during the 2004-2007 period is made up of direct and indirect aid.
Between 2002 and 2007, direct Community aid accounted for 70% (EUR 970 million) of the total Community aid, while indirect Community aid, managed by international organisations, accounted for 30% of Community aid (EUR 422 million).
However, the lack of coordination at international level between the donor countries needs to be recognised.
This situation also exists between different European Union Member States and the Commission at a time when they could play a unifying role.
As a direct consequence of this, the cost/efficiency ratio is much lower than it should be and there is the conviction that the Afghan population could have benefited to a much greater extent from the international and Community funds allocated to this country.
(EL) Madam President, there can be no doubt that in Europe we are today suffering the consequences of an anarchic, eccentric American/Anglo-Saxon model of organising the financial markets, which learned how to function without rules, without supervision and without democratic accountability and which, of course, polluted the global and European economy.
With the texts which we are debating today and will vote on tomorrow, we are building a protective shield here in Europe for the citizens.
A protective shield which will safeguard them from this paradox in which we are currently living, where money flows are supranational and the rules of supervision and accountability, where there are any, are national.
So Europe is reacting, albeit slowly, but better late than never.
This, of course, leaves two major questions which need to be answered.
The first question is: why did we need to live through a crisis in order to react?
Why did we need to wait for all this to happen in order to introduce rules?
The answer will be given by the citizens, by rewarding those who are calling for legislation and punishing those who wanted to persuade us that self-regulation is the panacea for all the evils we are experiencing today.
The second question is, will these texts that we are debating today be the only ones or will there be overall supervision and an overall review of the legislative and regulatory framework?
The answer to this second question will be given by us because, as co-legislators, we shall exert pressure so that we do not just stay with the Gauzès report on credit rating agencies, which failed to see the iceberg coming towards the Titanic, which is why what happened did happen, but which quickly saw that certain Member States needed to be downgraded because they did not 'allegedly' have an adequate credit rating.
We need to examine and correct all this from the beginning: nothing will remain the same in the European Union after the current crisis.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening.
I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy.
I believe this is an area where, if Member States work together, Europe can ensure secure, cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens.
Together, we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events, such as the gas disruption Europe experienced last winter.
Of course, Europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes, but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures, and make the market more transparent and efficient.
Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda.
Last year, we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market.
A regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in Parliament and tomorrow's vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable.
In this context, I think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers, by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty.
It is a very important institutional, political and legal point.
This regulation is not only a tool for collecting information; it can also give an overall picture of investments in energy infrastructure as a basis for policy making.
So, in the event that the Council adopts this regulation on the wrong legal basis, I consider that Parliament should pursue this matter further at the European Court of Justice, and let me assure you, it will.
On the substance now; I have said this before to Mr Barroso and I will say it again to you, Commissioner Oettinger: Europe is standing at a turning point and our priority now should be more than ever to support our companies and create a positive environment for competitiveness.
We therefore need strong policies and especially a stronger reliable energy policy.
The aim in the end is to ensure secure and cheap energy for both our citizens and our companies.
In this perceptive, I should hope that gathering data will not become a purpose in itself.
We have to make sure that this regulation will not create yet another bureaucratic burden on companies and that confidentiality of commercially sensitive information will be reinforced.
On another issue, I can only regret that the PPE and S&D Groups introduced an amendment requiring EU companies to provide data on investments in projects in third countries.
I challenge anyone to find the legal basis in the treaties that would allow extra-territoriality in energy policy.
Furthermore, I believe we should first start proving that we know what is planned at European level before looking outside our borders.
I have also noticed the temptation in this House to include everything in this regulation.
I think that this is a mistake.
For this instrument to be efficient, we must focus on real consistent information and keep in mind avoiding too much bureaucracy and confidentiality issues for our companies and the Commission.
I have tried to achieve this balance by, on the one hand, giving the Commission the opportunity of having an overview of possible future developments but also, on the other hand, ensuring that this picture is as accurate as possible.
We also need some certainty about future investments to ensure proper and solid policy making.
I would also need to be reassured, Commissioner Oettinger.
I want to avoid a situation where the Commission, having gathered the data, starts imposing investment plans and ends up telling companies not to invest here but there.
However, it should provide solutions and incentives for companies to make short-term non-profitable investments which may be needed to ensure security of supply, otherwise the loopholes will remain.
I am stopping here.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your comments.
Brussels, 23 November 2001
The Commission has approved a Leader+ Community Initiative programme for the Italian Region of Lombardia.
The goal, he went on, was to improve the quality of life of those living in rural areas.
Leader+ would help to add value to local products and to make the best use of natural and cultural resources.
The programme's overall objective is to stimulate the socio-economic vitality of the areas concerned by disseminating models for sustainable, locally generated development.
Lombardia will select six local action groups to implement it.
To ensure a bottom-up approach, each local action group will draw up a development plan setting out specific measures and objectives based on the characteristics of the area covered by the programme and in line with the general priorities and strategies laid down in advance.
The local action groups will be selected on the basis of their structure and organisation and the quality of the strategies outlined in their development plans.
What is Leader+?
Leader+ is the new Community Initiative for rural development, one of the four Initiatives implemented under the Structural Funds in 2000-06.
Total EU funding for Leader+ in this period will top €2 billion, financed by the EU agriculture budget via the EAGGF Guidance Section.
The emphasis will be on cooperation between rural areas and their networking.
All EU rural areas are in principle eligible under the Leader+ Initiative.
Mr President, the EU is in crisis in terms of direction and legitimacy, and Mr Blair is now under challenge to fill the leadership vacuum, with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder weakened domestically and probably on their way out.
The UK is right to question the entire EU budget architecture based on a distorted, wasteful common agricultural policy, which harms developing world farmers.
Our rebate will never be given up until the CAP is radically reformed, with the funds freed up, used to address modern priorities like research and development, combating climate change and external action funding to stabilise the Western Balkans, help Eastern European countries like Ukraine and fledgling democracies in the Middle East such as Iraq.
This is happening at a time when the US is anxious to mend fences with the EU and needs our help.
As a priority, I hope that Britain will put the roadmap for Arab-Israeli peace back on the agenda and combat nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea.
I support EU enlargement with a wider, looser flexible Europe.
I welcome the proverbial Polish plumber and recognise that the new countries are driving the economic reformist agenda.
We are now committed to Romania and Bulgaria.
As much as I support Ukraine’s EU aspirations, we have not carried Europe’s public with us on enlargement.
I hope the UK will emphasise human rights violations in brutal regimes such as Burma and Zimbabwe.
As a Commonwealth country, we have a very special influence on these countries in Africa.
At the summit meeting with Russia, it will need reminding of its obligations in Chechnya and must be made to understand that it must respect the sovereignty of its former satellites such as Ukraine.
In the case of Moldova and Georgia, it should be encouraged to withdraw its troops.
Mr Blair, you might also might want to use some of your goodwill with Turkey to resolve the Armenia embargo and border issue.
Lastly, we must maintain the arms embargo on China, with its lamentable human rights record and threats to Taiwan.
Certainly, building a multi-polar world with China and the EU as a counterweight to the US should play no part in this issue.
Unconventional Monetary Policy on Stilts
NEW YORK – With most advanced economies experiencing anemic recoveries from the 2008 financial crisis, their central banks have been forced to move from conventional monetary policy – reducing policy rates via open-market purchases of short-term government bonds – to a range of unconventional policies.
Although the zero nominal bound on interest rates – previously only a theoretical possibility – had been reached and zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) had been implemented, growth remained anemic.
So central banks embraced measures that didn’t even exist in their policy toolkit a decade ago.
And now they are poised to do so again.
The list of unconventional measures has been extensive.
There was quantitative easing (QE), or purchases of long-term government bonds, once short-term rates were already zero.
This was accompanied by credit easing (CE), which took the form of central-bank purchases of private or semi-private assets – such as mortgage- and other asset-backed securities, covered bonds, corporate bonds, real-estate trust funds, and even equities via exchange-traded funds.
The aim was to reduce private credit spreads (the difference between yields on private assets and those on government bonds of similar maturity) and to boost, directly and indirectly, the price of other risky assets such as equities and real estate.
Then there was “forward guidance” (FG), the commitment to keep policy rates at zero for longer than economic fundamentals justified, thereby further reducing shorter-term interest rates.
For example, committing to maintain zero policy rates for, say, three years implies that interest rates on securities with up to a three-year maturity should also fall to zero, given that medium-term interest rates are based on expectations concerning short-term rates over the next three years.
Capping things off, there was unsterilized currency-market intervention to boost exports via a weaker currency.
These policies did indeed reduce long- and medium-term interest rates on government securities and mortgage bonds.
They also narrowed credit spreads on private assets, boosted the stock market, weakened the currency, and reduced real interest rates by increasing inflation expectations.
So they were partly effective.
Still, in most advanced economies, growth (and inflation) remained stubbornly low.
There was no shortage of reasons for this.
Given deleveraging from high private and public debts, unconventional monetary policies could prevent severe recessions and outright deflation; but they could not bring about robust growth and 2% inflation.
Moreover, the policy mix was suboptimal.
While monetary policy can play an important role in boosting growth and inflation, structural policies are needed to increase potential growth and keep firms, households, banks, and government from turning into zombies, chronically unable to spend because of too much debt.
And fiscal policies were also necessary to support aggregate demand.
Unfortunately, the political economy of most structural reforms – with their front-loaded costs and back-loaded benefits – implies that they occur only slowly.
At the same time, fiscal policy has been constrained in some countries by high deficits and debts (which jeopardize market access), and in others (the eurozone, the United Kingdom, and the United States, for example) by a political backlash against further fiscal stimulus, leading to austerity measures that undermine short-term growth.
So, like it or not, central banks became and still are the only game in town when it comes to supporting aggregate demand, lifting employment, and preventing deflation.
As a result, unconventional monetary policies – entrenched now for almost a decade – have themselves become conventional.
And, in view of persistent lackluster growth and deflation risk in most advanced economies, monetary policymakers will have to continue their lonely fight with a new set of “unconventional unconventional” monetary policies.
Some have already been implemented.
For example, negative interest policy rates (NIRPs) are now standard in Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, the eurozone, and Japan, where the excess reserves that banks hold with central banks as a result of QE are taxed with a negative rate.
Policymakers have shifted from working on the quantity of money (QE, CE, and foreign-exchange intervention) to working on the price of money (first ZIRP, then FG, and now NIRP).
Nominal interest rates are now negative not only for overnight debt, but also for ten-year government bonds.
Indeed, about $6 trillion worth of government bonds around the world today have negative nominal yields.
The next stage of unconventional unconventional monetary policy – if the risks of recession, deflation and financial crisis sharply increase – could have three components.
First, central banks could tax cash to prevent banks from attempting to avoid the negative-rate tax on excess reserves.
With banks unable to switch into cash (thereby earning zero rates), central banks could go even more negative with policy rates.
Second, QE could evolve into a “helicopter drop” of money or direct monetary financing by central banks of larger fiscal deficits.
Indeed, the recent market buzz has been about the benefits of permanent monetization of public deficits and debt.
Moreover, while QE has benefited holders of financial assets by boosting the prices of stocks, bonds, and real estate, it has also fueled rising inequality.
A helicopter drop (through tax cuts or transfers financed by newly printed money) would put money directly into the hands of households, boosting consumption.
Third, credit easing by central banks, or purchases of private assets, could broaden significantly.
Think of direct purchases of stocks, high-risk corporate bonds, and banks’ bad loans.
If unconventional unconventional monetary policies sound a little crazy, it’s worth remembering that the same was said about “conventional unconventional” policies just a few years ago.
And if current conditions in the advanced economies remain entrenched a decade from now, helicopter drops, debt monetization, and taxation of cash may turn out to be the new QE, CE, FG, ZIRP, and NIRP.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
. Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Freitas for this report, as well as for his interest, participation and input in the Committee on Fisheries.
I would also like to thank the President and the members of the committee for its expeditious examination of this proposed regulation.
This will enable the European Community to pass a clear signal to the AIDCP at its Annual Meeting beginning on 13 June 2005, that with the adoption by Parliament of this proposal from the Commission, the European Community is well on the road to completing the necessary internal procedures to becoming a full member of this organisation.
I am pleased to accept a number of amendments suggested by Mr Freitas, notably Amendments 2, 3, 5 and 6. In particular, these amendments will increase the transparency and simplify the understanding of the content and reasoning behind the need for this Council decision, which will enable the Community to fulfil its international obligations to become a party to regional fisheries organisations where they exist and to defend Community interests in the global fisheries.
This will also enable the Community to be at the forefront of these organisations and enhance the leading role that it has constantly played in the operation of regional fisheries organisations.
I am not, however, in a position to accept the remaining proposed amendments, with the exception of Amendment 4, which I can accept provided that the phrase ‘and its certification scheme’ is deleted.
I will comment on the certification scheme later with respect to other amendments.
I find difficulty in accepting the other amendments for the following reasons.
This proposal relates to the approval of AIDCP, whereas Amendments 1, 9, and 11 focus heavily on a secondary issue of the AIDCP, namely, the tuna tracking and verification system, which is already EC law.
Amendment 10 requires that future changes to the tuna tracking and verification system regulation follow a certain process, in contradiction to the appropriate comitology provisions within the regulation.
This regulation is already in force and changes can be made to it as and when necessary.
Amendments 7, 8, and 12 relate to the issue of AIDCP certification and consumer information.
Again, such amendments are not helpful in this instance since the issue of whether the Community accepts AIDCP certification is still being considered by the Member States and, pending such a consultation, the Commission has not adopted any fixed position.
The inclusion of any reference to certification is premature and could prejudice the internal debate that still has to be concluded.
Furthermore, the issue of certification is not one of the objectives of the AIDCP, nor is it included in the general measures of the AIDCP Agreement, nor in the application of the AIDCP Programme itself.
This is a secondary commercial economic interest that is a consequence of the implementation of part of the AIDCP, and not a core element.
Mr President, once again I should like to thank all the speakers in tonight's debate for their extremely positive contributions.
The Commission supports the approval of the report on the regional impact of earthquakes.
Citizens expect the Member States and institutional bodies to act effectively and in a spirit of solidarity when faced with disasters.
The prevention of environmental damage and damage caused by human activity entails the strengthening and development of civil protection resources and capabilities at local, national and European level.
The Commission is confident that Parliament will continue to endorse and support this aim in the future.
Lastly, let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that on 22 and 23 November, the Commission is holding its second civil protection forum in Brussels.
The forum will be attended by approximately 500 participants who work in the field of civil protection or have an interest in it.
It will enable participants to exchange ideas and will give them a chance to meet others who share their interest in civil protection and who work in the same field.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to take part in the forum and meet the civil protection community.
Once again let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, on his excellent report.
.
Mr President, when considering the case of Somalia, I think it is worth taking something of a backward look into its history.
What the West did to Somalia involved the application of every bad policy imaginable.
Let us recall the intervention in 1993, which ended up as a fiasco.
Germany had stationed troops there, who were meant to be supporting Indian troops, but these never actually turned up.
We have to face up to the fact that, as soon as the troops were withdrawn, there was scarcely any interest in Somalia any more.
Things in Somalia have now rearranged themselves.
The coalition, whose members are described as Islamists, have, slowly but surely, achieved military dominance, and the troops that the press describe as being supported by the USA – the Warlords Alliance, that is – have been pushed further and further back.
It is obvious that the US administration, in particular, has backed the wrong horse and now sees its own policies in virtual ruins.
The question now arises as to what the European Union can do about this state of affairs.
It would be quite utterly wrong to support one of the parties to the conflict on the ground, and it needs to be stressed above all that since, at the moment, Ethiopia and Eritrea have a manifest and considerable interest in using Somalian territory as a place in which to settle their differences by force of arms, it is very important that the European Union should, through diplomatic channels, make it perfectly plain to both of them that this is just not on.
As things stand at present, I see absolutely no sense whatever in foreign military intervention in Somalia, within which there are certain regions that are stable; Somaliland is one of them.
For that reason, no troops must be sent, nor must there be any support for the deployment of them, or else we will again end up with what has come to pass often enough already, namely, the creation of a Frankenstein’s monster, for support was given to this or that grouping, which then did the very thing that it was intended should be avoided.
I therefore urge that any action there on the part of the European Union be diplomatic in character.

State aid: Commission launches investigation into state loan granted to Czech airlines
The European Commission has today decided to launch an investigation into a loan granted to ČSA – Czech airlines a. s. by the State-owned entity Osinek a. s. to determine if these actions are compatible with the EU State aid rules.
The investigation will give all interested parties the opportunity to submit their comments.
Therefore, the Osinek loan is no longer secured by assets.
The Commission will particularly assess whether a private investor would have acted in the same way as the Czech Government.
It does not prejudge the final decision of the Commission.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.
New publications of state aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the State Aid Weekly e-News .
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: Railway accident in Buizingen and electronic safety system
The serious railway accident in Buizingen, Belgium, on 15 February 2010, is being blamed on the absence of an electronic safety system which automatically applies trains' brakes if they pass a red light.
In addition to the national automatic train protection (ATP) systems, which have existed for years in some Member States, work is proceeding apace on the introduction of ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) in Europe.
To what extent and for how long have the various Member States been equipping their railway lines and trains with national ATP systems?
What is the state of play with the introduction of ERTMS in the various Member States (both on trains and on railway lines)?
In the case of Member States which do not yet have national train protection systems, is it still worthwhile to invest in them, in view of the ongoing introduction of ERTMS and the major investment involved in a changeover?
How is the danger averted that railway infrastructure may be equipped with ERTMS but the trains may not, or vice versa?
Does this problem arise at present, for example for intercity railway traffic on the Liège-Aachen line?
What lessons should we perhaps learn here with regard to the liberalisation of the railways in Europe?
Subject: Causes of the dreadful train crash on Monday, 15 February in Buizingen
Can the Commission demonstrate whether liberalisation has affected safety?
In June 2008, the Commission sent Belgium a reasoned opinion formally criticising the complex three-part structure of Belgian Railways.
Have the requisite measures since been taken in response to the objections raised by the Commission?
How?
Since when has the European ERTMS standard been available?
Did any delay occur in comparison with the scheduled date of introduction?
If so, what were the causes of this delay and what remedial action has the Commission taken?
Did the debate on the European standard prevent the railways from introducing a system of their own to guarantee safety on domestic routes?
Since when have the specifications for such national systems been available?
In how many of the EU-27 countries does a national system already exist, and since when has it done so?
Which countries score best?
What is Belgium's position in relation to the EU-27 regarding safety of the railway network?

Keep the Geeks in Charge of the Internet
LOS ANGELES – The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly transformed the Internet into the most critical infrastructure on Earth.
By enabling people and businesses to remain connected while under lockdown, the Internet has helped to prevent the global economy from collapsing entirely.
Indeed, with fear and social distancing continuing to separate many of us, it has become the connective tissue for much human interaction and economic activity around the world.
Project Syndicate commentators have once again shared some of their favorite books from the past year. From economics, history, and long-form reporting to poetry and timely re-issues of old classics, all readers should find something of interest.
But few appreciate how this critical global resource has remained stable and resilient since its inception, even as its scope and scale have undergone uninterrupted explosive growth.
In an age of widening political, economic, and social divisions, how has the “one Internet” connecting the entire world been sustained?
And how can we best continue to protect it?
The answers to both questions start with understanding what makes the Internet – which consists of tens of thousands of disparate networks – look like and function as one network for all.
These components, or unique Internet identifiers, include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are associated with every device connected to the Internet, and Internet domain names (like ft.com, harvard.edu, or apple.news), which we use to search for and connect to computers easily.
These unique identifiers ensure that, no matter where you are or which network you are connected to, you will always get in touch with the right computer with the desired domain name, or reach the right target device with an embedded IP number (such as a smart thermostat, for example).
This simple, elegant architecture reflects the genius of a handful of brilliant engineers who created the Internet a half-century ago.
Since then, it has never failed to help us locate the billions of devices that have been added to the thousands of networks that make up today’s cyber economy.
Should the identifiers fail, we would experience immediate digital chaos.
Given the identifiers’ critical role, it is imperative that they not be compromised or controlled by any authority that is not committed to maintaining the Internet as an open, global, common good.
In the wrong hands, they could be used to fragment the Internet and enable top-down control of usage and users by governments with malign intentions.
And such fears are real, given authoritarian governments’ online meddling in elections, national security networks, and digital commercial transactions in the last few years.
So, the key question is who should be entrusted today to maintain the security and reliability of Internet identifiers.
The answer is simple: geeks, not governments.
Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more – All for less than $9 a month.
The same engineers who built the Internet established nonprofit institutions, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), to take responsibility for the unique identifiers and maintain the Internet’s original ethos of openness.
These and other institutions coordinate global efforts to manage the protocols necessary for the Internet’s stable and reliable operation, and the engineers who run them today do so with remarkable independence, precision, dedication, and humility.
The last major assault on these institutions’ independence came in December 2012, when a group of governments at the United Nations’ World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) attempted to take control of the unique identifiers.
This effort was thwarted thanks to the vigilance of democratic governments that valued the power of a single global Internet to foster innovation, commerce, and international cooperation.
But today, in the midst of the chaos caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, authoritarian governments are once again using the UN to try to seize control of critical Internet resources from engineers.
During a recent International Telecommunication Union meeting, a proposal for a new standard for core network technology was submitted.
Regrettably, and more worryingly, extreme activist groups and democratic governments also are carelessly intruding on the work of these independent institutions, for example to police free expression on social media.
For example, after Twitter attached a fact-check warning to two of US President Donald Trump’s recent tweets, he threatened that his administration would “strongly regulate” or close down social media platforms that he believes “silence conservative voices.”
Organizations such as ICANN and IETF have spent decades developing and refining consensus-based decision-making processes, involving inclusive and transparent “bottom-up” participation by engineers, businesses, civil-society organizations, and governments.
The danger is that by subverting these institutions’ established procedures, official interference and lobbying will make them easy prey for authoritarian regimes.
Attempting to reshape from outside the decisions of bodies like ICANN, or to fuel the efforts of authoritarian regimes to shift control of the Internet to governments within the UN framework, contradicts the Internet’s original ethos and could be devastating for us all.
We must commit to safeguarding the resilient system that enables the Internet to function free of political interference or control.
At a time when our physical and economic health are faltering in the face of a potent virus, protecting the independent, democratic, and transparent institutions that have dependably governed the Internet infrastructure since its inception has never been more important.
(PL) This is an important step for the European Parliament towards opening the door to nations which are obviously European, such as the Georgians and the Armenians.
Frankly speaking, it is a step which certainly is overdue.
It is a pity it did not happen two years ago, when Georgia became the object of Russian military intervention.
Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
I hope it will be given specific political content, and also that the EURONEST Parliamentary Assembly will play a role as an instrument of support for the ambitions of those states which are obviously European in outlook.
Finally, I would very much like those of us who are talking, today, about the democratic deficit in the countries of this region, to speak as clearly about the democratic deficit in a neighbour of these countries, I mean Russia, so that we do not have a double standard.

EU-ASEAN: Trade and Investment initiative makes headway
This is why we have no time to waste.
In the margins of the meeting, Pascal Lamy met with the Vietnamese Trade Minister Mr. Tuyen to advance on the bilateral EU-Vietnam deal for Vietnam's accession to the WTO.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I agree with the honourable Member, the European Union cannot and should not be responsible for everything, and should not be accused of or judged for everything.
According to the Treaties, many of those aspects and responsibilities lie with the Member States, and in this case may be responsibilities both of the Member States and of the States in which these situations occur.
The European Union is not and cannot be a universal panacea, particularly since there is a principle, the principle of subsidiarity, that must always be respected.
Subject: Non-EU financial services centres
Will the Council make a statement on how it engages with non-EU financial services centres on areas of mutual concern?
Of these consortia, currently totalling 158 in the twelve Community countries and the six EFTA countries (1), 153 have submitted at least one project.
A great success.
At a time when these technologies are developing ever more rapidly and when technological expertise is synonymous with economic competitiveness, it has become imperative that Europe train a maximum of people in new technologies.
In an effort to tackle this problem, cooperation has become a priority concept - cooperation between different European countries but also between universities and enterprises.
5,000 COURSES FOR 150,000 PEOPLE To reach its objectives and prepare for the Europe of tomorrow, the COMETT Programme supports various types of projects.
However, COMETT also directly funds student placements, staff exchanges, the organization of courses and the development of training materials.
The second phase, COMETT II, was launched in 1990 and will run until 1994 with a planned budget of 230 million ecu.
The number of projects has increased by an average of nearly 30 % since the Programme was initially launched.
In 1991, 414 projects were submitted by 153 UETPs for a total budget of 73 million ecu.
Of the 414 projects submitted, 140 proposed placements for almost 15,000 students.
In terms of total cost, the sectors best represented in 1991 are the following : the environment, information technologies, automation, agro- food and materials.
392 PROJECTS SELECTED IN 1991 A total of 392 projects were approved in 1991.
A total fo 21 million ecu will be allocated to these 392 projects.
The environmental sector alone will receive over one million ecu, or 5 % of the total budget.
In terms of amounts allocated, this sector is followed by information technologies, automation, production and manufacture, agro-food and materials.
To this budget of 21 million ecu must be added the sum of 25 million which will be used to finance projects approved in 1990 on a multi-annual basis.
In total, COMETT will devote 46 million ecu to training in the field of new technologies in 1991.
Madam President, I would not wish to try Parliament's patience, but all the same, I do need to clarify a number of things for the MEPs here present and for Parliament.
When, a year and a half ago, I took on the portfolio of commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security, I found on my desk two large-scale information technology projects aimed at equipping the Member States with modern and effective cooperation tools.
Those two projects, SIS II and VIS, formed part of the same contract, signed in 2003, between the Commission and a consortium of information technology companies.
Both of these projects are technologically complex.
We need to interconnect a central system and national equipment with particularly demanding specifications, and make them interact.
I have always tried to keep Parliament informed of these developments.
Following the Justice and Home Affairs Councils in February and June 2009, I wrote to Mr Deprez, the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to inform him of how the work on SIS II was progressing.
I sent you a copy of that correspondence, Mr Coelho, because you are the usual rapporteur for SIS-related issues, and you follow these issues closely.
Motivated as I am by this spirit of openness, I should like today, once again, to give you as much information as possible.
It is true that, like most major industrial projects, both SIS II and VIS are in danger of going over schedule and over budget.
It is true that the situation is unsatisfactory as regards both SIS II and VIS.
Despite the involvement of experts from the Commission and the Member States, SIS II continues to come up against various obstacles.
VIS, for its part, has entered an important phase.
The initial specifications made it difficult to perform the planned tests but it seems that, with the Member States' agreement, the review of these specifications should enable the tests to be completed successfully next time.
I come firstly to SIS II. The Commission is working closely with the Presidency, the Member States and the contractors to implement the guidelines laid down in the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 4 and 5 June.
Firstly, all the parties concerned are actively involved in the technical preparations for a first 'milestone' test aimed at ensuring that the current technical solution is built on a solid foundation.
With this in mind, the Commission has negotiated the contractual changes required with the consortium in charge of the project.
For the first milestone, there is an extra cost of EUR 1 026 000.
At the same time, our services have stepped up the governance and monitoring of the project.
They have introduced contractual penalties so as to put added pressure on the contractor.
On Friday evening, I summoned and met with the CEO of the company in charge of the project so that he could inform me personally of the measures that he was implementing to resolve the technical difficulties.
Finally, for precautionary purposes, as was stipulated by the June Council, the Commission has begun the preparatory work with a view to potentially switching to the alternative scheme should the current technical solution fail.
In order to take account of this data and of the new timetable, we must obviously translate these circumstances into legislation.
That is why, on 29 September, the Commission proposed some amendments to the SIS II migration instruments, amendments on which your Parliament is currently being consulted.
This will give us an opportunity to review the issue in detail.
As regards VIS, in April 2009, the contractor began a series of tests on the central system in order to assess the progress made.
The contractor has not yet succeeded in meeting all of the contractual criteria required to conclude this series of tests, even though its deadline was extended.
The Commission has, of course, applied the contractual penalties provided for to punish this delay.
It has ordered the contractor to implement all of the appropriate corrective measures.
I do not believe, but I may be proved wrong, that there is a design problem.
On the other hand, it would seem that the STT is going well.
The tests should be concluded on 11 November.
However, in parallel to this, the Member States must also adapt their own national systems so that they can use VIS.
At least three Member States are encountering major difficulties, and the delays due to these three States are even more significant than those caused by the central system.
Thus, we are currently performing a detailed analysis with the Member States in order to set out a new timetable for the launch of VIS.
To do this, however, we need to have a clear idea of the outcome of the series of tests on the central system.
My meeting on Friday gives me reason to believe that 11 November could be the date when we will know whether the tests under way are successful.
In any event, however, both the national systems and the central system must be fully operational before the system is launched.
I will, of course, inform Parliament of this new timetable as soon as we have been able to draft it.
I shall finish here - please excuse me for my rather lengthy speech, but I really wanted to give a detailed account of the progress of SIS II and VIS.
There is real cause for concern; there is no point in hiding it.
The technical, budgetary and political risk profiles of both projects justify us all getting involved, given our respective responsibilities.
Significant financial resources have been harnessed.
The total amount of the Commission's budget commitments on SIS II stands at just over EUR 80 million, of which just over half, or EUR 44.5 million, have so far been paid.
The total amount that the Commission has already committed to VIS so far is in the region of EUR 74.5 million.
In terms of budgetary implementation, nearly EUR 43.3 million have actually been spent to date.
These figures are in line with those of projects on a similar scale developed in Europe and elsewhere in the world.
Madam President, I am anxious to say here that I will definitely inform Parliament of any developments that may have an impact on the budget, or indeed on the launch date for these systems.
However, if we succeed with VIS and SIS II, we will have equipped Europe with the most effective system in the world.
We therefore have to tackle the obstacles in a calm, clear and practical fashion, and in this respect, I will take the liberty of requesting Parliament's help as often as I need it in order, once again, to monitor these two issues very closely and to ensure their successful conclusion.
Commission clears acquisition by Vivendi (France) of US Filter (US)
The European Commission has approved the proposed acquisition by Vivendi of US Filter.
Although the operation will lead to further concentration in this sector, the Commission concluded that the merger will not create a dominant position given the strength of existing competitors on the market.
Vivendi is mainly active in the building industry; real estate; telecommunications and media and environmental activities.
For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the common market.
(ES) Mr President, in the event of paragraph 20 not being rejected, I propose an oral amendment:
'Otherwise, lesser-used languages and less-recognised languages, particularly in Western Europe, of the new Member States, will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages, especially English.'
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of referring this report back to the committee.
There was a lot of concern in committee when the vote was taken to reject this proposal and no doubt the groups involved had reasons for doing that, but one of the consequences was that many road safety issues were then rejected also.
Rather than go through the whole procedure in this plenary, my group and I feel that it would be far better if we refer the whole Markov report back to committee as of today, take it off the agenda and basically start again with our discussions between all the groups in the hope that we can come to a proper solution.

The Council also heard a report from the Director of Europol, Mr Jürgen Storbeck, on the activities of the Europol task force composed of anti-terrorist experts.
These documents stress the need to intensify the exchange of information between Member States and to continue elaborating a longer-term strategy to fight the terrorist threat, involving the participation of the Union, the Member States, Europol and the EU's partner countries.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACTIVITIES OF THE SPANISH PRESIDENCY
The Council was briefed on the activities of the Spanish Presidency on the topic of violence against women and the outcome of the Ministerial Conference on the subject which was held at Santiago de Compostela in February 2002.
The Council also took note of a Study and a Guide to Best Practice concerning violence against women, which were presented by the Spanish Presidency.
The Study was based on the replies given to a wide-ranging questionnaire distributed to Member States, resulting in a report on progress made in Member States on the measures proposed in the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women, to mitigate the effects of violence against them and eradicate this problem.
It also mapped out criteria for choosing examples of best practice used in the Member States, which have been collated in a Guide to Best Practice.
This Guide includes examples of measures implemented in the various Member States in order to mitigate the effects of domestic violence, sexual violence and violence in the workplace and to eradicate it.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND EXTERNAL BORDERS Council conclusions
The Council held a detailed discussion on the problems concerning illegal immigration and the management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union.
Among other things this debate revealed the need to follow a balanced and consistent approach to all issues relating to legal immigration, asylum policy and the fight against illegal immigration, as well as the need to set rapidly concrete deadlines for implementing operational deadlines.
Following the debate, the Council:
approved conclusions on the measures to be applied to prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings by sea (see below), and a plan for the management of the external borders.
As regards the measures to prevent and combat illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings by sea, the Council adopted the following conclusions:
"1.
INTEGRATED APPROACH
Combating illegal immigration with an integrated approach requires an increased effort from the European Union to prevent it and to approach the phenomenon in an appropriate way, using all the appropriate instruments at its disposal in the framework of EU external relations.
In this context, administrative capacity building as well as the adoption of appropriate legislation on asylum and migration issues by third countries concerned are of significant importance.
Specific attention should also be paid to the role of candidate countries.
European Union actions on combating illegal immigration will be in accordance with international human rights principles and obligations, and in particular the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as supplemented by the 1967 New York Protocol.
Combating illegal immigration and smuggling and trafficking in human beings will thus be a priority objective of the European Union, and must be integrated to a greater extent into the European Union's external relations, by the following means:
1.1. The fight against illegal immigration must be considered as an important aspect in conjunction with legal and political instruments currently being negotiated or to be negotiated in the future between the European Union and third countries.
1.2. A systematic assessment of relations with third countries which do not cooperate in combating illegal immigration, on the basis of a report by the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration.
This assessment should be taken into account in relations between the European Union and its Member States and the countries concerned, in all relevant areas.
1.3. An early political response by the European Union in the event of the arrival of flows of immigrants entering illegally, consisting of measures regarding the countries of boarding, departure or transit.
1.4. Support for third countries that are willing to cooperate with the European Union in:
1.4.1. Control and interception of vessels involved in smuggling and trafficking in human beings.
1.4.2. Readmission of immigrants who have arrived illegally in the European Union from such countries.
The European Union and its Member States, in their respective fields of competence, will consider offering, among others, resources and technical support to countries of boarding, departure or transit, to help them to apply the measures set out in section 3, without prejudice to other European Union policies that tend towards a global and balanced approach to the migratory phenomenon, with a view to joint control of migration flows.
The assistance mentioned will be provided in line with the willingness and needs of the authorities in the countries of boarding, departure or transit of the migration flows to cooperate, in particular in readmission, with the European Union.
2.
OPERATIONAL MEASURES BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES
Without prejudice to the future outcome of the feasibility study of the Commission, in the framework of the Comprehensive Plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, controls at external sea borders must be reinforced, on the basis of implementation by the European Union and its Member States of the following operational measures:
2.1. Systematic cooperation between the Member States and coordination with all the competent Authorities in view of possible joint operations in order to control sea borders and vessels suspected of being involved in smuggling and trafficking in human beings.
2.2. Increasing the focus on the work of liaison officers posted in the countries of boarding, departure or transit of immigrants who may illegally enter the European Union.
2.3. Improvement of the existing procedure for operating the Early Warning System.
2.4. Strengthening of Europol involvement in accordance with the Europol Convention, with the aim of collecting, classifying, analysing and providing the information available on the crimes of smuggling and trafficking in human beings in relation to illegal immigration by sea, including, as appropriate, the development of a database.
Cooperation of national police services with Europol should be strengthened.
2.5. The creation of joint investigation teams for concerted and effective action against organised networks and groups involved in smuggling and trafficking in human beings.
2.6. Use of appropriate measures to identify vessels in risk zones.
2.7. Operations both joint and carried on by individual Member States in maritime air patrolling and surveillance.
2.8. Adoption of European Union instruments concerning unauthorised entry, transit and residence.
3.
PREVENTIVE MEASURES WHICH SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY THE COUNTRIES OF BOARDING, DEPARTURE OR TRANSIT
The countries of boarding, departure or transit of the vessels should adopt the measures necessary to prevent and combat smuggling and trafficking in human beings by sea.
Failure of those countries to adopt such measures without good reason may give rise, in particularly serious cases, or for repeated minor incidents, to appropriate early political response, as referred to in point 1.3.
The measures to be adopted by countries of boarding, departure or transit should include the following:
3.1. Signing, ratification and application of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime of December 2000, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and other relevant international instruments, in particular the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as supplemented by the 1967 New York Protocol.
3.2. Making the smuggling and trafficking in human beings subject to criminal penalties, also involving confiscation of vessels used in such smuggling or trafficking, in its domestic legislation.
3.3. Imposing criminal penalties for conduct relating to the falsification and fraudulent use of travel documents.
3.4. Promoting or facilitating the running of awareness-raising campaigns, which will have the support of the European Union or its Member States, aimed at creating awareness of the problems and risks connected with illegal immigration.
3.5. An increase in control measures at sea borders for vessels suspected of being involved in smuggling or trafficking in human beings must be complemented by police controls inside national territory, aimed at breaking down networks of smugglers or traffickers in human beings, in line with the international instruments referred to in section 3.1.
3.6. Strengthening control measures at their borders, to prevent entry of persons wishing to use their territory as a transit path to move illegally towards European Union Member States, including possible adaptations of their visa system.
3.7. Cooperation with the border services of the European Union Member States to exchange information on vessels involved in smuggling and trafficking in human beings.
In this context, it will be necessary to intensify cooperation, so as to allow for the presence on the ground of liaison officers at ports and border posts.
3.8. A willingness to accept a readmission obligation in respect of any immigrants who illegally enter the European Union by sea and whose departure from or transit through the country in question can be adequately demonstrated.
3.9. Each country concerned should comply with the international maritime obligations for Search and Rescue Operations according to the international law and practice."
DETERMINING THE MEMBER STATE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXAMINING AN ASYLUM APPLICATION
The Council held a discussion on some basic issues identified by the Presidency relating to the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national.
The Ministers in particular emphasised the close link between this question and the issue of combating illegal immigration, both of which will be discussed by the European Council meeting in Seville, and also underlined the importance of reaching agreement on this subject in the near future.
The Council instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to continue its discussions on the basis of the Council's discussion.
POLICE AND JUDICIAL COOPERATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM
The Council agreed on a general approach on a draft Council decision on the implementation of specific measures for police and judicial cooperation to combat terrorism, pending the Opinion of the European Parliament and subject to withdrawal of a number of Parliamentary scrutiny reservations.
The draft, which is the result of an initiative by Spain, is aimed at stepping up, in the areas of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, mutual assistance on preventing and combating terrorist acts involving the people, groups and bodies mentioned in the Annex to Council common position 2001/931/CFSP.
EUROPEAN ENFORCEMENT ORDER FOR UNCONTESTED CLAIMS
The Council took note of progress achieved in examining the proposal for a Council Directive to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid and other financial aspects of civil proceedings.
It confirmed that the scope of the proposal should be restricted to legal aid for cases with cross-border implications and instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to expedite work on this subject.
MINIMUM PROVISIONS ON THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF CRIMINAL ACTS AND PENALTIES ON DRUG TRAFFICKING
The Council examined a proposal for a Framework Decision on the minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties on drug trafficking.
This proposal is aimed at punishing non legitimate production, manufacture, extraction, preparation, offering, offering for sale, distribution, sale, delivery, brokerage, dispatch, importation or exportation of drugs with maximum penalties of at least between 1 and 3 years of imprisonment.
A maximum of at least between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment is foreseen for cultivating drugs for drug production, possessing or purchasing drugs for conducting any of the activities described above or and the manufacture, transport or distribution of precursors in circumstances where the offence involves large quantities of drugs or either involves those drugs which cause the most harm to health or has resulted in significant damage to the health of a number of persons.
The Council noted that, subject to a number of parliamentary scrutiny reservations, a broad political understanding existed on the major part of this text, although further work would need to be undertaken by the Permanent Representative Committee on the issue of penalties, in accordance with national laws, for offences involving small quantities of drugs.
CIVILIAN ASPECTS OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT
The Council was informed by the Presidency of the positive outcome of the Rule of Law Commitment Conference.
The Council also noted the statement by the Rule of Law Commitment Conference.
This development buttresses the EU's ability to respond to crises, strengthening as it does the civilian dimension of the common European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP).
In 2001, Member States had already pledged to provide a total of 5000 police for crisis management operations.
OTHER BUSINESS
At lunch, Ministers heard an oral presentation by Commissioner Vitorino regarding the biannual update of the scoreboard to review progress on the creation of an area of "Freedom, Security and Justice".
MIXED COMMITTEE
The Mixed Committee met at ministerial level alongside the Council.
In particular, it noted that a general approach existed on a draft Decision amending Article 40(1) and (7) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, Council conclusions concerning the new requirements for SIS, and an agreement on the basic principles governing the participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the SIS and confirmed the agreement on the content of the plan for the management of external borders.
ITEMS APPROVED WITHOUT DEBATE

JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS
The aim of the Framework Decision is to approximate the definition of terrorist offences in all Member States, including those offences relating to terrorist groups.
Furthermore, it provides for penalties and sanctions for natural persons having committed or being liable for such offences.
The Framework Decision respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they emerge from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States as principles of Community law.
The European arrest warrant is a judicial decision issued by a Member State with a view to the arrest and surrender by another Member State of a requested person, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order.
It is executed by the Member States on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition, in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Decision and with due regard for fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles.
An arrest warrant may be issued for acts punishable by the law of the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least twelve months or, where a sentence has been passed or a detention order has been made, for sentences of at least four months.
In addition, a list of 32 offences give rise to surrender without verification of the double criminality of the act, provided they are punishable in the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence of a maximum of at least three years.
Each contact point's task is to provide on request any available information that may be relevant in the context of investigations into genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and to facilitate cooperation with the competent national authorities.
Europol
The Council:
decided to authorise the Director of Europol to conclude the draft Agreement between Europol and the World Customs Organisation.
The aim of the Agreement is to establish and maintain cooperation between the WCO and Europol in combating serious forms of international organised crime;
approved Europol's annual report for 2001;
approved Europol's work programme for 2003.
The aim of the recommendation is to encourage and facilitate cooperation and collaboration between national authorities responsible for the private security sector with a view to:
(a) exchanging experience in the handling of information supplied by private security firms in accordance with national law, which is material to public security;
(b) establishing best practice in the handling of information which is supplied by private security firms and is material to public security and organising, for the abovementioned purposes at least every two years, a meeting of the national authorities responsible for the private security sector.
Protecting the population against bacteriological, chemical, radiological or nuclear terrorist threats
The Council took note of the contribution of the Working Party on Civil Protection to the programme to improve cooperation in the European Union for protecting the population against bacteriological, chemical, radiological or nuclear terrorist threats
The Council further underlines that the prevention of crime is a necessary and essential component to realise an area of freedom, security and justice.
2 Notes with satisfaction that the EUCPN has, already in the first half yea r after being decided, established the necessary structures and procedures to be able to fulfil its mission and has therefore already become operational.
These measures include:
decisions on a first work programme and on the rules of procedure;
Supports the objectives, scope and priority subjects set out in the work programme, outlined in the annual report, and notes with satisfaction that concrete work to implement this programme has already begun.
The achievements during 2001 include:
the first steps to set up the EUCPN website for the dissemination of knowledge on crime and crime prevention in the EU Member States;
the planning of a conference for the exchange of best practices to be held during 2002;
pilot work on further developing comparable data on crime, criminal justice and victimisation in EU Member States;
the first steps to establish cooperation with other EU bodies in the field.
Reaffirms the importance of the role and work of the Member States in the development of crime preventive measures and emphasises the value of having several contact points representing different competencies and powers for the Member States.
Expresses its appreciation to the Presidencies, that have organised mandatory and other necessary meetings for the EUCPN and its national representatives at its own expense, and to the Commission for its support to the EUCPN.
The Council agrees with the EUCPN that the question of financing the EUCPN activities might need to be discussed in the future.
Reiterates the importance that the Presidencies plan the work of the EUCPN according to the work programme thereby ensuring the continuity of the work of the EUCPN.
Reaffirms the importance of continuing to work towards preventing juvenile crime, urban crime and drug-related crime, as outlined by the Council decision to establish the EUCPN., and supports the chosen top priority subjects, as outlined by the EUCPN in its first work programme.
Calls on the EUCPN to actively pursue its operational activities, and to establish realistic and measurable priorities, objectives and criteria for that purpose, particularly in view of the evaluation of the EUCPN to be carried out in 2004.
To that end an inventory of best practices should be carried out and, based on the inventory, priority areas should be selected and effectively implemented.
The Council welcomes the intention of the future Danish Presidency to organise a conference in October 2002 to begin that work."
United Nations Convention against Corruption
The Council adopted a second common position on the negotiations at the United Nations on the Convention against Corruption.
These contain, inter alia, provisions relating to the organisation and functioning of Eurojust, its operational rules and rules on relations with the institutions and bodies created by the Treaties.
Schengen evaluation of France
The Council approved conclusions on the Schengen evaluation of France.
Implementation of the European acquis in the field of Justice and Home Affairs
The Council approved revised and updated reports on the enactment, application and effective implementation of the acquis in Slovenia and Cyprus.
It also took note of an update on the work of the Working Party on Collective Evaluation, particularly taking into account progress in the negotiation process with the candidate countries.
8) the Council established a mechanism for collective evaluation of the enactment, application and effective implementation by the applicant countries of the acquis of the European Union in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Joint Action calls for the drawing up of evaluation reports on the progress and results of their alignment to the acquis.
To date the Council has, after a first series of country reports on all candidates, been able to take note of a second series of updated, revised versions on a majority of candidates.
Following the Council's decision that these reports should be used in the framework of the enlargement process, this was successfully done during the discussions establishing the common EU negotiating positions in 2000-2001 and during the present rounds of discussions thereon.
Common system for an exchange of visa data
In response to the request it received from the Laeken European Council, the Council approved guidelines for the introduction of a common system for an exchange of visa data.
It invited the Commission to prepare a feasibility study on setting up the system, taking account of the aspects covered in the guidelines, before March 2003, in accordance with the time limit laid down in the comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings in the European Union.
The Council asked the Permanent Representatives Committee to look into relevant issues in connection with introducing a common system for an exchange of visa data, in the light of the content of the guidelines and the Commission feasibility study.
The format will meet very high technical standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification.
The United Kingdom is taking part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
Ireland is not taking part in its adoption.
Denmark is not taking part in its adoption, but will decide in six months' time whether or not to transpose it into its national law.
(a) to promote cooperation between national agencies in implementing Community rules with special attention to the pooling of resources and coordinated and homogeneous practices;
(b) to promote uniform application of Community law in order to harmonise decisions taken by the national agencies of Member States, thereby avoiding malfunctioning likely to prejudice the progressive establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice;
(c) to improve the overall efficiency of national agencies in the carrying out of their tasks when implementing Community rules;
(d) to ensure that proper account is taken of the Community dimension in the organisation of national agencies contributing to the implementation of Community rules;

The EU's instrumental in strengthening action against illegal fishing
The European Commission welcomes the international Plan of Action to curb illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation).
"Illegal fishing is a scourge which compromises our efforts to achieve sustainable fisheries and, if not curbed, even threatens to destroy entire fisheries.
This plan of action will help the international community to fight back", Franz FISCHLER, Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries said.
From the start, the EU has been one of the most active promoters of the Plan of Action and has been extensively involved in its formulation.
The adopted Plan of Action clarifies these responsibilities and helps to fill a number of loopholes in international law.
However, there is also a need to implement existing international legal instruments.
In this respect, Mr FISCHLER regretted the fact that some EU Member States have still not ratified the 1995 United Nations Agreement on Straddling Stocks, which represents an effective instrument to combat illegal fishing.
"It is a pity that some Member States have failed to realise the urgency of enabling this Agreement to enter into force", he said.
The Plan includes a comprehensive set of measures around four main axes:
Flag State Control: each State is responsible for monitoring compliance by persons, companies and vessels under its jurisdiction with national, regional and international fisheries regulations;
Coastal State Control: States are responsible for monitoring fishing activities conducted in their waters;
Market Control: States must monitor goods imported or traded on their territory, so that no economic benefit is made from selling illegal goods.
An increasing number of vessels are being registered in countries which lack either the means or the will to control effectively the activities of vessels flying their flag.
It also underlines the need to strengthen control and enforcement throughout the fisheries chain, from the catching, to the landing and marketing.
In order to ensure rapid implementation of the measures foreseen, the Plan of Action calls on all States to draft national action plans and to co-operate with all parties concerned.
The Action Plan also stresses the importance of Regional Fisheries Organisations in the fight against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.
As some have already done, such organisations may take dissuasive trade measures, agreed multilaterally, to avoid illegal imports and discriminatory trade.
The Plan of Action also underlines the need to address the specific needs of developing countries to enable them to acquire the means to implement this Plan.
The international action against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is included in the context of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries which was adopted in 1995.
Brussels, 23 September 2005
The European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation under the EU Merger Regulation of Swiss-based Omya’s proposed acquisition of J.M. Huber’s On-site Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (“PCC”) Business.
Six of these plants are in the EEA, the rest are in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Russia.
This case was originally referred to the Commission by the Finnish Competition Authority who considered the deal to have a European dimension.
The opening of this in-depth investigation does not in any way prejudge the final outcome.
Were competition to be reduced in this sector, it would result in increased costs for a wide range of European businesses.
The case was referred to the Commission by the Finnish Competition Authority under Article 22 (1) of the Merger Regulation and the Austrian, French and Swedish competition authorities also joined the referral, under Article 22(2) of the Regulation.
They act as filling agents which reduce the need for tree pulp, and as coating agents giving the finished product the right colour, desired opacity and receptivity to printing.
J.M. Huber also supplies minerals to the paper industry and is intending to sell off all of its on-site PCC production plants to Omya, six of which are in the EEA.
Omya already has four on-site PCC production plants, of which two are in the EEA.
The Commission takes the view that there is a serious risk that effective competition will be impaired in these concentrated and complex markets, and that a closer analysis is therefore necessary.
This will focus on the possible creation of a dominant position or even of collective dominance amongst the players in the carbonates markets supplying the European paper industry.
in writing. - (PT) I would like to express my profound sympathy and solidarity with the people of Madeira, their institutions and the regional government in view of the tragedy of force majeure which occurred on 20 February in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and which caused several dozen deaths, disappearances, displaced persons, injuries and huge material damage.
This situation requires rapid and effective measures of solidarity from the EU.
Hence, it requires the greatest possible promptness of all those involved in the allocation of the Solidarity Fund, so that it can be mobilised without delay.
It is also crucial that the various funds of the European Union be mobilised in a flexible manner, through advance payments, simplified procedures and a higher rate of cofinancing in order to meet the needs of the Autonomous Region of Madeira.
We advocate that the Solidarity Fund should be revised in the manner that has already been requested by Parliament.
This fund must function as an emergency fund in which lead times are much reduced and the sums made available are increased.
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 22 October 2009.
Written statements (Rule 149)
(DE) Madam President, first of all I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski.
You can see by the very high attendance at this late hour how important the report is and you can also hear how emotionally charged the atmosphere is as we listen to the various contributions from different nationalities and groups.
It is therefore a compliment that the paper has actually been written and adopted.
As rapporteur for trade and economic relations between the EU and Russia, I would like to raise two aspects and then make a general comment.
The first aspect concerns the bilateral energy agreements.
If I read it correctly, the Saryusz-Wolski report is 'towards a common European foreign policy on energy'. In other words, this common foreign policy on energy does not yet exist.
While it still does not exist, it must therefore be possible to find other ways to talk about energy.
The Member States are able effectively to agree among themselves - this is highly desirable, it is not a chore.
It is not possible to impose a veto on bilateral agreements.
It is a credit to the rapporteur's realism - because I know that he wanted something else - that he has written this in his report in this way.
My second point: combining the energy charter with Russia's WTO membership.
Linking ratification of the energy charter with accession to the WTO is a backward step.
It is also advantageous for the EU if Russia is a member of the WTO.
Moreover, we are not able to make a decision on this alone.
The rapporteur's report in favour of the common energy policy leans towards Russia, but this is simply consistent with the situation today.
Europe needs more and "smarter" investment in both public and private research and development – not only does this boost growth in the medium-term, it also has a counter-cyclical effect in times of crisis.
Education systems need to be adapted to business innovation needs.
Innovative and fast-growing SME's need more encouragement.
A concerted effort is necessary to build on Europe's promising record in innovation tackling global challenges such as climate change.
The gender gap in science and research must be closed.
"This Report underlines that the road to the Innovation Union is long and challenging, with big obstacles along the way.
But it confirms that the EU has agreed the right policies to get to the end of that road.
The Report analyses the strengths and weaknesses of national research and innovation systems and provides solid facts on which to base national policy choices.
Key findings from the report
Europe needs to accelerate investment in research and innovation.
The EU is slowly advancing towards its target of investing 3% of GDP in research and development (2.01% in 2009) but the gap with leading competitors is widening notably due to weaker business R&D investment.
In 2008, 24% of the total world R&D expenditure was performed in the EU (29% in 1995).
Relative to GDP, business invests twice as much in Japan or in South Korea as in Europe.
In times of economic crisis, accumulated investment in research and innovation has a counter-cyclical effect.
Countries that have increased their investments in research and innovation have better prospects of getting out of crisis.
Seventeen Member States were able to maintain or increase their R&D budgets in 2009 and sixteen in 2010.
Investments in innovation have to be "smarter" .
The development of highly-skilled people needs to be matched with the needs of business.
Only 46% of EU researchers work in the business sector (80% in the US).
Member States should adapt their education systems to keep increasing numbers while ensuring a better match with business needs.
Integration and internationalisation of research increases returns on investments .
Internationalisation and efficient production of scientific excellence are mutually reinforcing.
However, they are concentrated among a few Western European countries.
Weak framework conditions prevent knowledge being transformed into marketable products and services.
Europe is losing ground in the exploitation of research results.
The EU is the first producer of peer-reviewed scientific publications in the world (29% in 2009) but the rate of growth of Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT) patent applications in Japan and South Korea is almost double that of the EU.
Half of the Member States do not produce high-tech European Patent Office (EPO) patents at all.
Further steps are needed to offer more cost-efficient intellectual property protection and management.
The EU patent currently being negotiated will be an important start.
Europe has strong potential in technological inventions tackling societal challenges.
In 2007, the EU accounted for 40% of patents related to climate change technologies.
This shows that targeted research and demonstration investment in key areas combined with measures to support market development can lead to new technologies and innovations.
We need more innovative and fast-growing SMEs.
In other words, it needs structural change both within and between sectors.
Some European countries such as Austria and Denmark have achieved a structural change to a more knowledge-intensive economy.
Many of these countries have also recovered better from the economic crisis.
Common features behind this success are innovative and fast-growing SMEs, benefitting from scientific excellence in public research and favourable framework conditions for bringing new knowledge to the market.
Background
Every two years, the Innovation Union Competitiveness Report – covering all 27 Member States and six Associated countries - will contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy by providing an in-depth statistical and economic analysis covering the main features of an efficient research and innovation system.
This is the first edition under the Innovation Union initiative (IP/10/1288 ) and replaces the former Science, Technology and Competitiveness Report.

Commission continues its assistance to the Benghazi HIV-AIDS sufferers
The European Commission has earmarked an additional €500,000 for continuing its support to Libya in its fight against the AIDS/HIV epidemic in Benghazi.
The EU intends to continue supporting the Libyan Authorities in the development of a national AIDS programme.
In the late nineties, more than 400 children and mothers have been infected by HIV/AIDS in Benghazi.
The model is now being adopted at the Jamahirja Hospital in Benghazi where other HIV sero-positive cases are treated.
At least 40 Libyan experts have been trained either in Benghazi or in Europe.
In September 2006, the Libyan health authorities requested the Commission to continue to support the process of BCIDI upgrading in order to secure the substantial results achieved during the first two phases, and to continue to support the development of the National AIDS Programme.
Several EU member States are also preparing measures to further contribute to the EU Action Plan for Benghazi.
For more information on the EU relationship with Libya:

The Directive aims at facilitating market entry, as well as at the taking up and pursuit of the business of electronic money issuance.
These rules, including their prudential dimension, are tailored to the specificities of electronic money activities and markets (2009/110/EC ).
Electronic money is a digital equivalent of cash, stored on an electronic device or remotely at a server.
But e-money can also be stored on (and used via) mobile phones or in a payment account on the internet.
The Commission's request takes the form of a reasoned opinion.
If the national authorities do not notify the necessary implementing measures within two months, the Commission may refer the Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Union and may request the Court to impose financial penalties.
What is the aim of the EU rule in question?
The directive aims at European level to:
enable new, innovative and secure electronic money services to be designed,
provide market access to new companies,
foster real and effective competition between all market participants.
This should benefit consumers, businesses and the wider European economy.
How are Member States not respecting this rule?
While the majority of the Member States have fully implemented the Directive, in these six Member States - Belgium, Spain, France, Cyprus, Poland and Portugal - some of the Directive's provisions still have to be implemented and the transposition process is very slow.
How are businesses suffering as a result?
If the Directive is not fully implemented in all Member States, companies can not reap the benefits of a clear legal framework designed to strengthen the internal market while ensuring an adequate level of prudential supervision.

Brussels, 31 January 2008
The European Commission has decided to refer three Member States to the European Court of Justice over non-implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC), known as 'MiFID', and its implementing Directive (2006/73/EC).
The Member States concerned are the Czech Republic and Poland for Directive 2004/39/EC and the Czech Republic, Poland and Spain for Directive 2006/73/EC.
The benefits of this regime cannot be fully realised by firms from Member States that have not transposed the Directives, and also by firms from other Member States wishing to operate on the territory of Member States that are late in transposing.

Brussels, 23 March 2011
Solar Factory, a 100% subsidiary of SolarWorld AG, produces solar modules on the basis of crystalline silicon.
The investment project takes place in Freiberg (Chemnitz, Saxony), Germany, an area eligible for aid under Article 107(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as a region with an abnormally low standard of living and high unemployment.
Solar Factory already operates two manufacturing facilities for solar modules in Freiberg.
The new investment substantially increases the existing production capacity through the construction of a third plant (SF III) in the industrial zone Freiberg Saxonia.
Works on SF III started in early 2010, and are planned to be completed in 2011.
Considered separately, the aid would not have to be notified to the Commission, because it is to be granted under existing schemes already authorised by the Commission and the aid amount does not exceed the notification threshold .
The Commission's investigation found that even if the notified project were to form a single investment project with previous SolarWorld investments, the aid to be granted would be within the thresholds of the Regional Aid Guidelines.
The Commission also calculated that Solar Factory's market shares on the world market for solar modules are well below 25% before and after the investment.
As these thresholds are not exceeded, the Commission concluded that the positive impact of the investment on regional development outweighs the potential distortions of competition.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number N 365/2010 in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.

They are not part of the Union territory, but their nationals are, however, to a large extent citizens of the Union.
By contrast, ACP rice exported directly from an ACP state to the Community qualifies only for a reduction in customs duty of 50% within an annual quota of 125 000 tonnes, subject to various conditions.
As a result, total imports of OCT rice to the Community rose from 58 000 in 1992 to 192 000 tonnes in 1995, and reached 365 029 tonnes in 1996.
The 59 610 tonnes remaining are reserved for rice originating in the other OCTs.

Commission earmarks €8 million in humanitarian aid for Cuba
The European Commission has adopted an intervention plan, providing €8 million of funding for vulnerable people in Cuba.
The funds will be channelled by the Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) through partner organisations working in the country.
The decision focuses on elderly and disabled people who have no family support or resources, living both in the community and in social institutions.
Ten non-governmental organisations will be involved in implementing the plan.
ECHO's activities are being wound down in Cuba with a view to terminating operations by the end of December 2001.
This readjustment of policy, which takes place within the framework of the EU Common Position on Cuba, reflects changes occurring in the Cuban economy and society.
In the period 1993-2000, ECHO spent €78 million in humanitarian aid in Cuba.
A Green European Budget
PARIS – However predictable the difficult negotiations that accompany European politics may seem to be, in the end they seldom fail to surprise.
A crucial European Union summit aimed at securing a deal on the EU budget for 2014-2020, the so-called multi-annual financial framework (MFF), will take place later this week, and the mood music surrounding it has been intense, to say the least.
Before even a word has been spoken, Europeans are being told that the negotiations in Brussels will be “bad-tempered,” with vetoes by individual member states looming large.
Unfortunately, such talk could well become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Consider this: A group of major companies based in various EU countries – the likes of Tesco, Shell, Barilla, and Philips – are insisting that whatever its final size, the MFF deal should commit to a proposed minimum of 20% of spending in 2014-2020 on green and low-carbon growth.
These are the same companies that Europe’s national governments court and listen to on a daily basis.
But, when it comes to the MFF, Europe’s national leaders appear not to be listening closely.
Nor do they say much about the obvious dividends that such spending could provide, from the United Kingdom in the west to the EU’s newest candidate country, Croatia, in the east.
Europe’s 500 million citizens may not be surprised by what is playing out in the corridors of power, but they ought to find it very disturbing.
The issue is not only what could be lost in the race to the bottom in which many EU national governments are now engaging, but also the manipulative anti-EU sentiment coming from many quarters of the European press, which appears intent on pushing various national leaders into another budget showdown.
In the EU’s western, net-contributor states, the MFF debate remains narrowly focused on how much money can be cut from the European Commission’s proposed €1.033 trillion ($1.3 trillion) budget for 2014-2020.
Next to nothing, though, is being said about the Commission’s more important, and more integral, proposal: the 20% spending commitment for projects and initiatives that can stimulate resource-efficient business, protect Europe’s collective, boundary-less environment, and ensure a better future for families across the continent.
The dividends promised by a “green” MFF (which recently received the support of the European Parliament) are at least threefold: a higher share of jobs in one of the world’s fastest-growing economic sectors; lower energy bills for households throughout Europe; and help in achieving the reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions to which all EU states have agreed as part of their “Europe 2020” commitments.
The green potential within EU spending has already taken root.
In France, for example, social housing organizations have rapidly deployed €320 million of EU money in the last few years to improve energy efficiency in existing housing stock.
This European finance triggered additional investment of €2.2 billion, created 15,000 local jobs, and has resulted in savings of €98 per month per household, thanks to a 40% average decrease in heating costs.
Recently, Michael Heseltine, a former minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government, stressed the importance of wind energy for deprived regions of the United Kingdom, such as the northeast of England.
And yet the penny has not dropped in London that focusing European investment funds accordingly would create opportunities to build stronger businesses and increase competitiveness in the technologies of the future – and to share these gains within and beyond the EU.
Instead, in the UK and elsewhere, the predictable MFF chest-thumping that is now underway threatens to dispatch this kind of opportunity to the bin beneath the negotiating table.
Europe has come a long way since 1951 and the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the EU.
But we are now in the process of constructing the EU economy anew, striving to overcome the economic crisis, and creating a more sustainable, globally competitive, and resilient European economy – an economy that can be green as well as productive.
The EU’s heads of government need to understand the bigger picture as they prepare for this week’s MFF summit.
Europe’s common good – indeed, its most promising path to a prosperous future – is at stake.
Madam President, today’s debate is not directly concerned with European solidarity, the cohesion policy or the sharing out of EU funds.
In reality, however, it is not too far removed from debates on the solidarity principle or on the factors driving economic development, in particular those factors that promote or hinder the existence of functioning economies in the Member States.
Decisions on State aid granted at regional level fall entirely within the jurisdiction of the European Commission. At the same time, however, Parliament cannot merely be a passive observer of developments in this field, given that it is working actively on a legislative package on cohesion policy.
Particular emphasis should therefore be placed on a point made in the report, namely that we expect the Commission to delay its adoption of a position until the new Financial Perspective is agreed on, and until the budget for cohesion policy is adopted.
Regulations on levels of State aid should, if they are formulated correctly, heighten the impact of structural interventions rather than curtailing economic freedoms, by which I also mean business activity.
State aid should not become an alternative means of artificially prohibiting such measures as the relocation of businesses.
Economic activities in the Member States should also be targeted at creating an environment that is conducive to investment in the EU, and at establishing favourable operating conditions that enable forward planning for businesses, rather than at imposing artificial prohibitions that disrupt relations between EU Member States.
The consultation of regional and local authorities on the criteria for identifying aid-recipient regions is also absolutely essential.

These certificates concern beef with bones, canned and dry petfood and breeding sheep and goats and open up new trade opportunities for European producers.
The position of the Commission in these negotiations was agreed with the Member State authorities in the Council of the EU.
Another goal of these negotiations is to conclude new veterinary certificates for other commodities.
In 2009 the value of exports of animals, meat and animal products from the EU to the Russian Federation was € 1.3 billion.

. I voted in favour of the Recommendation for Second Reading by Mr Medina Ortega (A6-0073/2004) on civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles.
The development of the internal market, and the increase in Community traffic have meant that for ten years we have needed to update the rules in force.
It was therefore necessary to update and strengthen protection through compulsory cover for victims of accidents caused by one motor vehicle, and to ensure greater convergence in the way in which Member States interpret and implement the directive.
With this fifth Directive it will be easier to obtain effective and valid civil liability insurance outside the country of residence, and to sell or buy a vehicle in another Member State.
Furthermore, this text increases legal protection for the victims of accidents.
I also feel that it is extremely important to highlight Parliament’s proposal as regards a transitional period of up to five years to enable Member States to adapt to the minimum cover amounts.
(FI) Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Mitchell's speech, as of course, the primary human right for each girl and boy is the right to be born into this world.
The Human Rights Council is the UN's main body responsible for human rights, and now at last we must venture critically to assess its status and policies.
The Council at its best could have a decisive role as a promoter of human rights and democracy.
Unfortunately, its work is characterised by double standards, selectivity, politicisation and the creation of blocs in human rights issues.
It is typical that the Council was very close to adopting the resolution on progress (progress mind!) in the human rights situation in Libya.
Among the countries giving Libya recognition were Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan.
Do declarations by these countries carry any weight?
Should these countries not be the next to be expelled from the Human Rights Council?
Just the fact that such a resolution was even considered shows just how ignorant the international community has been or has wanted to be concerning the situation in Libya.
Over the last few decades, however, around two thirds of the condemnatory resolutions that the Human Rights Council has adopted have concerned Israel, which is nevertheless the sole democracy in that area of the Middle East.
At the same time, it has ignored the poor state of the rights of women and minorities in all the surrounding Arab countries.
The work of the Human Rights Council will lack credibility unless it changes that work and its ways of working.
Madam President, the European Parliament is delighted to welcome you to its plenary sitting, and it is an honour for me to welcome the first woman to be elected President of an African country, as well as the delegation of Ministers and Members of Parliament accompanying you.
I must tell my fellow Members of the European Parliament that the President’s delegation contains more parliamentarians than ministers.
I would like to remind this House that you were also the first woman to become Finance Minister in your country in 1979, 27 years ago now.
Unfortunately, your country suffered a coup d’état in the following year. In 1980 there began a quarter of a century of violence in Liberia, a 14-year civil war, the systematic plundering of the country's resources and a mass violation of the human rights of its inhabitants.
The results of this horrendous and long war – as long as the old religious wars of Europe – could not have been more tragic: 250 000 victims in a country of three million people - almost 10% of the population.
A million people had to leave their homes − some of whom are now returning − and there was a mass rape of women − more than 25 000.
During that era, three quarters of the population were ‘living’ – if it can be called living – on less than one dollar per day, and up to 85% of the population were unemployed.
In other words, there was no economy in the sense that we understand it in the developed Western societies.
Madam President, under those circumstances it cannot be an easy task for any politician to take on the presidency of a country.
Our Parliament is delighted with the role that the Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) played in the peace talks in 2002 that led to the presidential elections that you won last November.
The European Parliament sent observers to those elections, and the head of the delegation, Mr van den Berg, made it clear in his report that, despite a few small incidents, the elections had taken place in accordance with the rules governing them.
We are therefore receiving you today as a symbol of the rule of law, of peace, of democracy, of women's rights and of the fight against corruption and impunity.
If you read the President of Liberia’s biography, you will see how often she has resigned from her posts because she disagreed with the ways governments were tackling the problem of corruption in her country.
You will also remember that last April, here in plenary, I had the opportunity to express my satisfaction at the arrest and extradition of Charles Taylor, which the European Parliament had called for in various resolutions and which were finally carried out at the request of the President.
This represents progress in the fight against impunity for war criminals throughout the world.
It is therefore something that we welcome, and I wished to say this today while you are here.
After so much suffering, we want to offer you our support.
It is good that the guns have fallen silent.
As soon as the guns fall silent, however, the task begins of reconstructing the country – a task that is of less interest to the television cameras – and the danger is that it may be forgotten now that the battlefield has been abandoned.
This would not be the first time that, having found peace, a society has not found the road to reconciliation and the economy has not found the road to development.
In travelling along that road, Madam President, you will find that Europe will be there to help you in order to ensure that Liberia continues to be that symbol of liberty that it was at its birth.
Our hope and desire is that you can build a future of hope for all of the people of your country which will serve as a symbol for the whole of Africa.
You have the floor, Madam President.
