The machine translation preserves most of the meaning and is mostly fluent. However, there are a few minor differences in wording and sentence structure compared to the human reference. For example, ""ohne triftigen Grund"" (without good reason) in the human reference is translated as ""ohne Angabe von Gründen"" (without stating reasons) in the machine translation. Additionally, the sentence ""Er ergänzte, dass der Aufenthalt im Land ausschließlich Passagieren mit einem Nachweis eines solchen Tests gestattet ist"" (He added that only passengers with proof of such a test are allowed to stay in the country) in the machine translation is slightly different from the human reference ""Sie fügten hinzu, dass nur Passagiere, die ein Zertifikat für einen solchen Test haben, ins Land gelassen werden"" (They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test will be allowed in the country)."

The machine translation preserves most of the meaning and is mostly fluent. However, there are some minor errors in word choice and sentence structure that make the translation slightly less fluent than the human reference. For example, ""hörte es sich jedoch an"" is not the most natural way to translate ""appeared to say"" and ""Er sollte unbedingt entfernt werden"" is not an accurate translation of ""Surely it should come down."" Overall, the translation is still very good and conveys the main message accurately."
